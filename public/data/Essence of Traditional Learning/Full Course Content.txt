Hello Learners, in the last video we discussed on the Course Contents of Essence of Traditional
Knowledge, in this video, let us try to understand the Definition and meaning of Traditional
Knowledge.

•

Traditional knowledge refers to the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous
and local communities around the world.
• Developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to the local culture and
environment.
• It tends to be collectively owned and takes the form of stories, songs, folklore, proverbs,
cultural values, beliefs, rituals, community laws, local language, and agricultural
practices, including the development of plant species and animal breeds.
• Traditional knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation orally.
• “Traditional knowledge” is an open-ended way to refer to tradition-based literary, artistic
or scientific works; performances; inventions; scientific discoveries; designs; marks,
names and symbols; undisclosed information; and all other tradition-based innovations
and creations resulting from intellectual activity.
Definition
• The definition of traditional knowledge used by the World Intellectual Property Office
(WIPO) includes indigenous knowledge relating to categories such as agricultural
knowledge, medicinal knowledge, biodiversity- related knowledge, and expressions of
folklore in the form of music, dance, song, handicraft, designs, stories and artwork.

What is Traditional Knowledge?
Medicinal, Agricultural
& Ecological Knowledge

Music & Dance,
Stories & Poetry

Artesanat
(Handicrafts)

Spiritual Expression

Transmitted
orally across
generations

Collective
responsibility &
ownership
Constantly evolving

How do Native people define traditional knowledge?
• It is practical common sense based on teachings and experiences passed on from
generation to generation.
• It is knowing the country. It covers knowledge of the environment - snow, ice, weather,
resources - and the relationships between things.
• It is holistic. It cannot be compartmentalized and cannot be separated from the people
who hold it. It is rooted in the spiritual health, culture and language of the people. It is a
way of life.
• Traditional knowledge is an authority system. It sets out the rules governing the use of
resources - respect, an obligation to share. It is dynamic, cumulative and stable. It is
truth.
• Traditional knowledge is a way of life -wisdom is using traditional knowledge in good
ways. It is using the heart and the head together. It comes from the spirit in order to
survive.
• It gives credibility to the people.
Comparisons between indigenous and scientific knowledge
• The interest to compare scientific and traditional knowledge comes from collecting
traditional knowledge without the contextual elements.
• For example, Native people have a far richer and more subtle understanding of the
characteristics of ice and snow than do non-indigenous people. In fact, some Native
classification is available only by virtue of its relationship to human activities and
feelings. These comparisons sometimes incorrectly lead science practitioners to trivialize
traditional understanding.
• For many indigenous people today, the communication of traditional knowledge is
hampered by competition from other cultures that capture the imagination of the young.
They are bombarded by technology that teaches them non-indigenous ways and limits the
capacity of elders to pass on traditional knowledge to the young. As the elders die, the
full richness of tradition is diminished, because some of it has not been passed on and so
is lost. It is important therefore to find ways of preserving this knowledge.
In this video, we understood the meaning and definition of Traditional knowledge and the
comparison between indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge and in the next video, let
us understand the Comparisons between traditional and scientific knowledge with respect to its
style and with respect to its use.

Hello learners.
Welcome to the Indigenous Knowledge session. In this session, we will talk about
indigenous knowledge and its definition, characteristics of indigenous knowledge, the
significance of indigenous knowledge, the importance of indigenous knowledge,
challenges faced, and the difference between indigenous knowledge and western
knowledge. Indigenous knowledge or IK refers to the skills, knowledge, and beliefs
utilized by native people to survive in a given geographic region. The knowledge
accumulated by indigenous or local communities over generations living in a specific
environment can also be broadly construed as indigenous knowledge or IK. The term
encompasses all forms of knowledge, technologies, skills, practices, and beliefs that
assist the community in creating stable livelihoods within their respective
environments.
Let’s see the definition of indigenous knowledge.
Indigenous knowledge can be defined as "A body of knowledge built up by a group of
people through generations of living in close contact with nature" (Johnson, 1992). As
per UN, the term "Indigenous" is defined as "Groups of people whose social, cultural
and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national
communities, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or
traditions or by special laws or regulations. People in independent countries who are
regarded as indigenous are considered as descent people who inhabited geographical
region to which belongs, at the time of colonization or the establishment of present state
boundaries".
Most people think of indigenous knowledge as outdated, backwards, static, or
'unchanging.' Indigenous people are the first settlers in a specific location, who have a
different culture and belief system example, the local Tribal, Native, First, or
Aboriginal populations.
It has led to widespread use of the term local knowledge, which refers to any
knowledge possessed by a group that lived off the land for a long period in a particular
area.
In this approach, it is not necessary to understand whether the people in question
are the original inhabitants of an area. What is important is to identify how people aboriginal or non-aboriginal - in a particular region view and interact with their

environment, so that their knowledge can be mobilized for the design of effective
interventions.
So, what are the characteristics of indigenous knowledge?
Its fundamental principles are dynamic, methodical, and universal.
The transmission occurs verbally rather than in writing.
It is based on teachings and knowledge experience that are passed down from
generation to generation.
It is holistic in nature.
It can give people credibility.
It is based on observational experience and may be beneficial for decision
making.
It governs the use of resources.
It is a way of living for their survival.
It is associated with the sustainable use of native resources.
Examines the holistic understanding of biological and human systems.
Let’s now look at the significance of indigenous knowledge.
 The survival of every human being depends on the wholeness of nature and the
elements it contains.
 It describes the specific circumstances of communities in connection to the
environment and offers practical solutions to people's issues.
 It explains how cultural behaviours resulted from human adaptation to their
environment
 Knowledge about 'Indigenous or Traditional knowledge' is a mix of simple but
applied education, economics, politics, religion, sciences, and technologies found
in indigenous societies.
 It is fundamental knowledge, but it provides a rich foundation for the
development of modern society.
So, why indigenous knowledge is important?
Indigenous knowledge is given for local empowerment and development, increasing
self-sufficiency and strengthening self-determination.
 The indigenous population can also contribute valuable information regarding
how to manage the local environment.
 Indigenous knowledge offers local communities, particularly the marginalized,
with problem-solving solutions.
 Indigenous knowledge on development challenges is an important component of
global knowledge.
 Indigenous knowledge is a valuable resource that is less utilized in the
development process.
 Using indigenous wisdom to obtain a deeper understanding of your surroundings
might be beneficial.

Let’s look at the challenges faced in using indigenous knowledge.
 Lack of adequate management
 Lack of documentation
 Understanding their knowledge is eroding
 Less importance is given to indigenous knowledge
Commercialisation and economic instability can destroy indigenous knowledge
So, how indigenous knowledge is different from western knowledge. Let’s see.






Indigenous knowledge is a visual representation of oral knowledge whereas, western
knowledge is based on written words.
Indigenous knowledge is learning by doing and experiencing whereas, western
knowledge is through formal education.
Indigenous knowledge has a holistic approach whereas, western knowledge has a
reductionist approach.
Indigenous knowledge is subjective and western knowledge is objective.
Indigenous knowledge sharing is through storytelling whereas, western knowledge is
through a didactic approach.

With this, we come towards the end of our session. In today’s session, we discussed
about indigenous knowledge and its definition, characteristics of indigenous knowledge,
the significance of indigenous knowledge, the importance of indigenous knowledge,
challenges faced, and the difference between indigenous knowledge and western
knowledge.
I hope you would have got a fair understanding of the essence of indigenous knowledge
Thank you and Happy Learning!

Summary

Technical advice is required to be circulated among community mem
bers such that they
are able to make effective utilization of systems of IPR.
● The representatives of the community members should be encourag
ed by local state
authorities so that they take more active participation in annual and q
uarterly meetings
held by the WIPO agency.
● The members of the WIPO agency should provide assistance to stre
ngthen and develop
regional and national systems for safeguarding traditional knowledge.
The tools for the
protection of traditional knowledge include the imposition of laws, re
gulatory policies,
practical instruments and the use of information systems.
● There is also a need for providing “handson training” system for the management of
“intellectual property rights” and boosting interests of the people for d
ocumenting traditional cultural manifestations and knowledge.

Year of the study

2020

Objectives

To investigate zootherapeutic uses among two tribes who inhabit differ
ent areas of North-East India: the Tangsa and the Wancho.

Methodology

Field Survey from May 2015 to March 2016

Findings

Researchers found that the Tangsa make greater use of animals than
Wancho and use predominantly a variety of mammals (47%) followe
d by birds (16%) of the 55 species of animals considered therapeutic
by them.
The Wancho informed us of using 20 species, of which birds and thei
r products account for 37%, while mammals and insects feature in 26
% and 21%, respectively.

The tribal people must understand that preserving their traditional kn
owledge of animals and their products to treat diseases and disorders
depends on the availability of the raw material, i.e. the animals.
Summary
To discourage needless killing of the latter and help tribal people to a
dopt an attitude that sees modern and traditional therapies side by sid
e, effectively substituting each other, is a challenge of the future that
needs to be met.
Declaring certain species, threatened by extinction, taboo by elders o
r influential community leaders (cf., MeyerRochow 2009) rather than increasing fines could also help in this cont
ext.

Hello Learners,
In this session let us discuss on the Traditional Medicine and Herbal Healing Practices
in India
Traditional Medicine
•

Do you all know what is traditional medicine

•

Are we using any herbal medicine in the present day

•

Do we know the origin and development of medicine in India

Rig-Veda, considered as one of the oldest treatises of human knowledge which was created
during 4500 BC to 1600 BC. It is supposed as the ancient repository that stated about
therapeutic usages of plants of the Indian subcontinent
Introduction
India has a rich traditional knowledge and heritage of herbal medicine.
India is the largest producer of medicinal herbs and is called as botanical garden of the world.
But due to easy availability and fast action conventional allopathic medicines are used in
large scale, the significance of traditional medicines went down.
In recent times due to side effects and growing cost of allopathic medicine, people are now
looking for alternative medicines, herbal medicines being one of them.
Summary of Literature
Traditional medicine particularly herbal medicine considered as a major healthcare provider
around the globe particularly in rural and remote areas. A large section of people depends on
such medicine for their primary healthcare. Indian traditional medicine or medicinal plants
are also considered as a vital source of new drug. Mainstreaming of such medicine is
important for the people. Several steps have been taken in India to promote such medicine
and to integrate them with the modern medicine.
•

Evidence of ancient medicinal systems in India were traced back at the time of the
Indus valley civilization. Archeological evidence of Harappa and Mohanjodaro
suggested the presence of a traditional medicinal system at that time. It was
interpreted that use of plants, animals and mineral based drugs were done by Indus
people.

•

The contribution of plants, as raw material for making medical formulations, is
significant in the Indian systems of medicine, and over 6,500 species of plants are
known to occur in India those are used by various streams of traditional health care
practitioners.

•

The traditional system of medicine in India functions through two major streams – the
local health tradition and the classical scientific system of medicine. The carriers of
local health care system are millions of people who cure diseases at home as a birth
attendant, bonesetters, and practitioners of snake bite treatment, jaundice treatment
etc. The classical scientific system of medicine has evolved with the philosophical

explanation and is expressed in various manuscripts. Such system of medicine exists
in the name of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Tibetan
Ayurvedic system of medicine
•

The Ayurvedic system of medicine is an age-old system of therapy, which is
associated with the Vedic civilization in India. The oldest existing literature on this
form of treatment is mentioned in Rigveda around 4500-1600 B.C. Ayurveda is a
holistic system of treatment, which is amalgamation of use of food, medicine and
other measures like exercise and behavior (Kala, 2006a; Katiyar, 2006). Life in
Ayurveda is conceived as the union of body, senses, mind and soul. Ayurveda regards
human body is a composition of five basic elements namely, earth, water, fire, air and
vacuum (ether), and any illness is considered the result of absence of a balanced state
of the total body matrix. The disease is diagnosed by examining the general physical
condition of the patient and pulse reading, along with examining urine, excreta, eyes,
tongue, skin, and auditory functions. Once disease is diagnosed, the treatment
measures involve use of medicines, specific diet and prescribed routine activity

Unani system of medicine
•

The Unani system of medicine was originated in Greece and later introduced in India
by Arab and Persians. Like Ayurvedic system, the Unani system of medicine
prescribes daily diet quantity to patient and also depends on whole drug therapy in
which the active principle of drug is not isolated (Ansari, 2006). Unani medicine
assumes that the drugs possess their own temperament to act. They may be hot, cold,
moist and dry. Similarly, each individual possesses his own temperament, physical
structure, self-defense mechanism and reaction to environmental factors. The
medicine is thus prescribed based on such factors of the person undergoing the
treatment (Rais, 1986; Ahmad, 1992).

Siddha medical system
•

The Siddha medical system is originated in southern India during 10th to 15th century
and like most of the traditional systems of medicine it follows pulse reading to
diagnose the ailments (Daniel, 1984). In Siddha, like Ayurveda, any ailment in human
body is thought a result of imbalance of three humors – bile (pitta), wind (vayu) and
phlegm (kaph). This system of medicine has developed and accumulated a rich
treasure of therapeutic knowledge in which use of metals and minerals is often
prescribed (http://indianmedicine.nic.in/). It also emphasizes on individualistic
approach of treatment as it takes into account the age, sex, habitat, appetite, mental
frame, physical condition and surrounding environmental of the patient.

Tibetan medical system
•

Tibetan medical system is flourished in the trans-Himalayan region, especially in
Tibet, Ladakh and Lahaul-Spiti where the earlier inhabitants used to practice
shamanism under the name Ban (Dash, 1994; Kala, 2003). In due course of time,
Bauddha Bhiksus (monks) introduced the knowledge of Ayurveda, and propagated it
among their disciples in Ladakh, Lahaul-Spiti, Tibet and wherever they preached.
This system of medicine follows the procedure of pulse reading, and the number of

pulse beats during one respiratory cycle indicates the status of health. Plant forms
major ingredient in Tibetan medicine, besides animal products, minerals and salts
(Kala, 2005, 2006b).
Role of plants in ISM
•

Wide arrays of plant species are used in traditional system of health care in India.
Over 6,500 species of plants are known to occur in India those are used by various
streams of traditional health care practitioners. Approximately 2000 medicinal plant
species are used alone in Ayurvedic system of medicine, which is followed by Siddha
(1121), Unani (751), Homeopathy (482) and Tibetan (337).

•

The number of people involved in the traditional health care system is quite
impressive in India. About 7,00,000 practitioners of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Yoga,
Naturopathy and Homeopathy are registered in the Indian Systems of Medicine. And
a sizeable number of practitioners in rural and far-flung areas are not yet registered.

•

Family traditions and cultural preferences also make people to own, decide and prefer
various health care systems. In India, medicinal plants have strong acceptance in
religious activities, where the plants are worshiped in the form of various gods,
goddesses and local deities

•

Different parts of medicinal plants were used as medicine by the local traditional
healers. Among the different plant parts, the leaves were most frequently used for the
treatment of diseases followed by whole plant parts, fruit, stem, root, stem and root
bark, seed, flower and latex. The methods of preparation fall into four categories, viz.:
plant parts applied as a paste (38%), juice extracted from the fresh plant parts (24%),
powder made from fresh or dried plant parts (20%), some fresh plant parts (6%), and
decoction (12%). External applications (mostly for skin diseases, snake bites and
wounds) and internal consumption of the preparations were involved in the treatment
of diseases.

Herbs and their healing practices
Let’s learn of few herbs and its healing practices
•

Medicinal plants such as Aloe, Tulsi, Neem, Turmeric and Ginger cure several
common ailments. These are considered as home remedies in many parts of the
country. It is known fact that lots of consumers are using Basil (Tulsi) for making
medicines, black tea, in pooja and other activities in their day-to-day life

•

Herbs such as black pepper, cinnamon, myrrh, aloe, sandalwood, ginseng, red clover,
burdock, bayberry, and safflower are used to heal wounds, sores and boils.

•

Many herbs are used as blood purifiers to alter or change a long-standing condition by
eliminating the metabolic toxins. These are also known as 'blood cleansers'. Certain
herbs improve the immunity of the person, thereby reducing conditions such as fever.

•

Some herbs are also having antibiotic properties. Turmeric is useful in inhibiting the
growth of germs, harmful microbes and bacteria. Turmeric is widely used as a home
remedy to heal cut and wounds.

•

Some herbs are used to neutralize the acid produced by the stomach. Herbs such as
marshmallow root and leaf. They serve as antacids. The healthy gastric acid needed
for proper digestion is retained by such herbs.

•

Indian sages were known to have remedies from plants which act against poisons
from animals and snake bites.

•

Herbs like Cardamom and Coriander are renowned for their appetizing qualities.
Other aromatic herbs such as peppermint, cloves and turmeric add a pleasant aroma to
the food, thereby increasing the taste of the meal.

•

Ginger and cloves are used in certain cough syrups. They are known for their
expectorant property, which promotes the thinning and ejection of mucus from the
lungs, trachea and bronchi. Eucalyptus, Cardamom, Wild cherry and cloves are also
expectorants.

•

Herbs such as Chamomile, Calamus, Ajwain, Basil, Cardamom, Chrysanthemum,
Coriander, Fennel, Peppermint and Spearmint, Cinnamon, Ginger and Turmeric are
helpful in promoting good blood circulation. Therefore, they are used as cardiac
stimulants.

•

Certain aromatic plants such as Aloe, Golden seal, Barberry and Chirayata are used as
mild tonics. The bitter taste of such plants reduces toxins in blood. They are helpful in
destroying infection as well.

•

A wide variety of herbs including Giloe, Golden seal, Aloe and Barberry are used as
tonics. They can also be nutritive and rejuvenate a healthy as well as diseased
individual.

•

Honey, turmeric, marshmallow and liquorice can effectively treat a fresh cut and
wound. They are termed as vulnerary herbs.

Hello Learners
In this session, let us discuss on the Yoga and Pranayama
•

Thousands of years ago yoga originated in India, and in present day and age, an
alarming awareness was observed in health and natural remedies among people by
yoga and pranayama which has been proven an effective method for improving health
in addition to prevention and management of diseases. With increasing scientific
research in yoga, its therapeutic aspects are also being explored. Yoga is reported to
reduce stress and anxiety, improves autonomic functions by triggering neurohormonal
mechanisms by the suppression of sympathetic activity, and even, now-a-days,
several reports suggested yoga is beneficial for physical health of cancer patients.
Such global recognition of yoga also testifies to India's growing cultural influence.

•

Yoga is an ancient discipline designed to bring balance and health to the physical,
mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of the individual. It is long popular
practice in India that has become increasingly more common in Western society.
“Yoga” means union of our individual consciousness with the Universal Divine
Consciousness in a super-conscious state known as Samadhi. The first book of
humankind, Rigveda, mentions about yogic meditation by the wise, while Yajurveda
exhorts us to practice yoga for enhancing mental health, physical strength, and
prosperity. Upanishads are replete with yogic concepts. In addition, yoga-related
terms like pranayama and samadhi occur repeatedly in Bhagavad-Gita. Ancient Indian
rishis understood that performing Raja-yoga (procedure of concentration to liberate
soul or atma from the bondage of maya into paramatma) always need a healthy body.

•

So, they developed “Hatha yoga,” which includes asana, mudra, pranayama, etc.
“Gharanda samhita” said there were 84 lakh asanas from which 16 000 were best and
only about 300 are popular. “Hathayoga-pradipika” again differentiates all asanas into
four basic classes – sidhyasana, padmasana, sinhasana, and vadrasana. Besides, asana
may be of two types – dhyanasana (a posture keeps spinal cord free and center of
gravity shifts to other part like ribs) and shasthyasana (to get healthy body).

•

Elementary courses of hatha yoga focus on physical exercises consisting of various
postures and breathing techniques. A growing body of research evidence supports the
belief that certain yoga techniques may improve physical and mental health through
down-regulation of the hypothalamo pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic
nervous system.

•

The stress and stress-induced disorders like hypertension and angina are fast growing
epidemics and bane of “modern” society. The holistic science of yoga is the best
method for prevention as well as management of stress and stress-induced disorders

•

Regardless of the pathophysiologic pathway, yoga has been shown to have immediate
psychological effects: decreasing anxiety and increasing feelings of emotional, social,
and spiritual well-being. Several literature reviews have been conducted that
examined the impact of yoga on specific health conditions including cardiovascular
disease metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cancer, and anxiety

ASTHANGA YOGA

Yoga (asthanga) is often depicted metaphorically as a tree and comprises eight aspects, or
“limbs” [Patanjali codified the ancient marvel of yoga as asthanga which is one of the six
schools of Indian philosophy and is known as Yoga Darshan : yama (universal ethics),
niyama (individual ethics), asana (physical postures), pranayama (breath control), pratyahara
(control of the senses), dharana (concentration), dyana (meditation), and samadhi (bliss).
Each limb is connected with the whole, in the same way that bodily limbs are all connected.
If someone pulls the body by the leg, the rest of the body will automatically follow. In the
same way, when one pulls one of the eight limbs of yoga, the others will naturally come.
1.Yamas
The yamas can be thought of as the ethical restraints that are necessary for achieving
harmony with other beings. The first limb of Patanjali’s eight limbs of yoga is Universal
Principals or Yamas and this includes five principles
•

Ahimsa (Non-Violence)

•

Satya (Truth)

•

Asteya (Non-Stealing)

•

Brahmacharya (Celibacy)

•

Aparigraha (Non- Accumulation)

2.
Niyamas
–
Observances
As with the universal principles or yamas, there are five niyamas. The niyamas are the
actions necessary for achieving balance within oneself
•

S a u c a (Cleanliness)

•

Santosa (Contentment)

•

Tapas (Forbearance of Opposites/ Perseverance)

•

Svadhyaya (Self-study)

•

Ishvara Pranidhana (Devotion to the Divine)

3. Asanas -Posture
•

Asanas are the physical positions or postures of yoga. Asana should be done with
three qualities: steadiness, comfort, and a spirit of joy. Through the practice of asana
one naturally comes to experience and be in harmony with infinity. Asanas purify the
body and mind, when practiced with full awareness; leave you with a feeling of
expansion and lightness. Each asana works to open channels of energy in the body
and in so doing releases blockages and tension which are held in the physical, mental,
and emotional bodies.

•

There are two types of asanas: dynamic and static. Static asanas are those that are held
for a period of time with no movement. The body remains as still as possible. These
asanas have a powerful effect on the life force (prana) and mental bodies, gently
massaging the internal organs, glands, and muscles and relaxing the nerves, bringing
tranquility to the mind. Dynamic asanas, which are more energetic, speed up the

circulation and loosen the muscles and joints, releasing energy blocks and removing
stagnant blood from different parts of the body.
4. Pranayama
•

Pranayama is not, as many think, something about the breath; breath, indeed, has very
little to do with it, if anything. Breathing is only one of the many exercises through
which we get to the real Pranayama. Prana, a word often used in yoga, is the vital lifeforce of life. When the prana in the body is low, one tends to be more lethargic, dull,
and unenthusiastic. Toxins then accumulate in these areas and pain, stiffness or
disease set in. Through the practice of yoga, prana begins to flow, allowing toxins to
be released and removed. On the other hand, the body is just a gross form of the mind.
They are not the separate entities often one thinks of them as and every mental knot
has a corresponding physical knot in the body and vice versa. The aim of yogic
practices is to release these knots and to connect us with the joy, love, and creativity,
integrating, and harmonizing the body and mind.

5. Pratyahara – Sense withdrawal
•

The word ahara means “nourishment”; pratyahara translates as “to withdraw oneself
from
that
which
nourishes the senses.” By quieting the senses and taking the mind inwards one can
unite
with
the
Self.
Pratyahara means drawing back or retreat. In yoga, the term pratyahara implies
withdrawal
of
the
senses
from
attachment to external objects. It can then be seen as the practice of non-attachment to
sensory distractions as one constantly returns to the path of self-realization and
achievement of internal peace

6. Dharana – Concentration and cultivating inner perceptual awareness
•

Dharma means “immovable concentration of the mind.” The essential idea is to hold
the concentration or focus of attention in one direction. When the body has been
tempered by asanas, when the mind has been refined by the fire of pranayama and
when the senses have been brought under control by pratyahara, the sadhaka (seeker)
reaches the sixth stage, dharana. Here he is concentrated wholly on a single point or
on a task in which he is completely engrossed. The mind has to be stilled in order to
achieve this state of complete absorption.

7. Dynana - Meditation
•

Dynana or meditation is all about just “being.” Meditation takes us back to that space
of “being” from where deep rest can be experienced and enormous energy and vitality
gained. Whilst effort is required to build the body, for example one has to work out
either at the gym or by doing various exercises and sports; it is quite the opposite with
the mind. The mind requires effortlessness in order to meditate. The less effort that is
applied in meditation, the deeper the meditation will be. To truly understand
meditation, it has to be experienced personally and like anything, the benefits can
only be experienced through dedicated practice and self-discipline.

8. Samadhi - Contemplation
•

According to Patanajali, “losing consciousness of the body, breath, mind, intelligence,
and ego” and residing in a state of peace and bliss in which wisdom, humility and
simplicity shine through, one is in a state of samadhi. Enlightened beings, which are
permanently in a state of samadhi, have the ability to illuminate all those who come to
him in their search for truth.

•

It is clear that at the beginning of the 21st century, by crossing the threshold from
traditional spiritual discipline to modern medical treatment and enriched with
scholarly evidence, yoga gets scientific justification as a useful practice for
maintaining health. It is one of the very few traditional disciplines that has gone
through this exam and gained confirmation. It seems that yoga has come full circle by
providing the techniques for living a meaningful and purposeful life, which are
important both from a medical and spiritual point of view. Moreover, through
aspirations of health benefits, yoga has focused the individual on the spiritual aspect
of existence.

So, learn yoga, Stay healthy
Thank you, learners, for listening this session

3. Indian Philosophy

Hello everyone,
Today in this session, we will discuss about Indian Philosophy and Significance of Sanskrit
Language
Indian Philosophy
•

Philosophy literally means the love of knowledge or more precisely, the love of
wisdom.

•

Like all other living beings, man struggles for existence. But while the lower beings
struggle more or less blindly without any conscious plan and purpose, and work by
instinct, man uses the superior gift of his intellect to understand the conditions and
meaning of the struggle and to devise plans and instruments to ensure success.

•

He wishes to lead his life in the light of his knowledge of himself and the world,
taking into consideration not merely the immediate results of his actions, but even
their far- reaching consequences.

•

Desire for knowledge springs, therefore, from the rational nature of man. Philosophy
is an attempt to satisfy this very reasonable desire. It is not, therefore, a mere luxury,
but a necessity

•

He wishes to lead his life in the light of his knowledge of himself and the world,
taking into consideration not merely the immediate results of his actions, but even
their far- reaching consequences.

•

Desire for knowledge springs, therefore, from the rational nature of man. Philosophy
is an attempt to satisfy this very reasonable desire. It is not, therefore, a mere luxury,
but a necessity

•

As philosophy aims at the knowledge of truth, it is termed in Indian literature, 'the
vision” Every Indian school holds, in its own way, that there can be a direct
realization of truth (tattvadarsana).

•

Ever since human beings have invented scripts, writing has reflected the culture,
lifestyle, society and the polity of contemporary society.

•

In the process, each culture evolved its own language and created a huge literary base.

•

This literary base of a civilization tells us about the evolution of each of its languages
and culture through the span of centuries.

•

Sanskrit is the mother of many Indian languages. The Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas
and Dharmasutras are all written in Sanskrit.

•

There is also a variety of secular and regional literature. By reading about the
languages and literature created in the past, we shall be able to understand our
civilization better and appreciate the diversity and richness of our culture.

•

All this was possible because of the language that developed during that time.,
Sanskrit which is the most ancient language of our country

•

The ancient period of Indian philosophy is the period of the composition of Vedas and
the Upaniṣads. The earliest Indian religious texts are the Vedas. The main
philosophical themes that the Upaniṣads explore are the nature of the Absolute
(Brahman) as the ground of being and the importance of knowledge of Brahman as
the key to liberation.

Vedas and Upanishads
Now let’s know about Vedas
•

The Vedas are the earliest known literature in India. The Vedas were written in
Sanskrit
and were handed down orally from one generation to the other.

•

The word ‘Veda’ literally means knowledge. In Hindu culture, Vedas are considered
as
eternal and divine revelations. They treat the whole world as one human family
Vasudev
Kutumbakam
There are four Vedas,

•

Rig Veda,

•

Yajur Veda,

•

Sama Veda and

•

Atharva Veda.

Each Veda consists of the Brahmanas, the Upanishads and the Aranyakas.
First let’s have a brief understanding of four vedas.
Rig Veda
•

The Rig Veda is the earliest of the Vedas. It is a collection of 1028 hymns in Vedic
Sanskrit. Many of these are beautiful descriptions of nature.

•

The prayers are largely for seeking worldly prosperity. It is believed that these
recitations are the natural outpouring of Vedic rishis experiencing a mentally
transcendental stage.

•

Some of the well-known rishis are Vasistha, Gautama, Gritasamada, Vamadeva,
Vishvamitra and Atri.

•

The prominent gods of the Rig Veda are Indra, Agni, Varun, Rudra, Aditya, Vayu,
Aditi and the Ashwini twins. Some of the prominent goddesses are Usha – the
goddess of dawn, Vak - the goddess of speech and Prithvi - the goddess of earth.

Yajur Veda
•

Yajur means sacrifice or worship. This Veda is concerned mostly with rites and
mantras of different sacrifices.

•

It gives directions for the performance of the yajnas.

•

It has both poetic and prose renderings. Being a treatise on rituals, it is the most
popular of the four Vedas.

•

There are two major branches of Yajur Veda, namely Shukla and Krishna Yajur
Veda i.e., Vajasaneyi Samhita and Taitriya Samhita.

•

This text reflects on the social and religious condition of India at that time.

Sama Veda
•

Sama means melody or songs. This Veda consists of 16,000 ragas and raginis or
musical notes.

•

Out of total 1875 verses only 75 are original and others are from the Rig Veda.

•

The Sama Veda prescribes the tunes for the recitation of the hymns of the Rig Veda.
It may be called the book of Chants (Saman).

•

This book is an evidence of the development of Indian music during this period.

Atharva Veda
The Atharva Veda is also known as the Brahma Veda.
•

It contains treatment for ninety-nine diseases. The source of this Veda is traced to
two rishis called Atharvah and Angiras.

•

The Atharva Veda is of immense value as it represents the religious ideas at an early
period of civilization.

•

This book gives detailed information about the family, social and political life of later
Vedic period.

Brahmanas and Aranyakas
•

After the four Vedas, a number of works called the Brahmanas were developed.

•

These books gave a detailed explanation of Vedic rituals and instructions and deal
with the science of sacrifice.

•

The latter portions of the Brahmanas were called the Aranyakas while the final parts
of the Aranyakas are philosophic books named Upanishads which belong to the later
stage of the Brahmana literature.

•

Each of the four Vedas have their own Brahmana books.

•

The Arayankas deal with soul, birth and death and life beyond it. These were studied
and taught by men in Vanprastha i.e. Munis and the inhabitants living inside the
forests. All these works were in Sanskrit. Initially they were handed down orally and
were put to writing much later.

Upanishad
•

The word Upanishad is derived from upa (nearby), and nishad (to sit-down), that is,
“sitting down near”. Groups of pupils sit near the Guru to learn from him in the Guru
shishya parampara or tradition.

•

The Upanishads mark the culmination of Indian thought and are the final parts of the
Vedas. As the Upanishads contain abstract and difficult discussions of ultimate
philosophical
problems, they were taught to the pupils at the end. That is why they are called the
end
of
Vedas.

Thank you, learners. In this session, I hope you learnt an introduction to Indian Philosophy,
significance of Sanskrit languages, brief understanding on 4 vedas and upanishads. Next
session we will know about the great Epics of our country, Ramayana and Mahabaratha
Thank you

Essence of Traditional Knowledge

Hello learners




In the last video, we discussed on the Concept of traditional knowledge, its
significance, comparision between tk& SK, understanding of Indegenious knowledge
and comparisons between Tk&WK
Today in this video, we are going to discuss about Introduction to Culture, Culture
and heritage of India and Characteristics

Culture
•

Culture refers to the patterns of thought and behaviour of people. It includes values,
beliefs, rules of conduct, and patterns of social, political and economic organisation.
These are passed on from one generation to the next by formal as well as informal
processes.

•

Culture consists of the ways in which we think and act as members of a society. Thus,
all the achievements of group life are collectively called culture.

•

Indian culture is the oldest of all the cultures of the world. Culture is the soul of
nation. On the basis of culture, we can experience the prosperity of its past and
present.

•

Culture is collection of values of human life, which establishes it specifically and
ideally separate from other groups.

Culture – what it means
•

The English word ‘Culture’ is derived from the Latin term ‘cult or cultus’ meaning
tilling, or cultivating or refining and worship.

•

In sum it means cultivating and refining a thing to such an extent that its end product
evokes our admiration and respect.

•

This is practically the same as ‘Sanskriti’ of the Sanskrit language.

Definition
•

A common anthropological definition of culture is that of pioneer English
anthropologist

•

Edward B. Tylor (Primitive Culture, 1871):
Culture “is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals,
custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of
society.”

•
•

Culture has two distinctive components, namely, material and non-material.
Material culture consists of objects that are related to the material aspect of our life
such as our dress, food, and household goods. MC includes technologies, instruments,
material goods, consumer goods, household design and architecture, modes of
production, trade, commerce, welfare and other social activities.

•

Non-material culture refers to ideas, ideals, thoughts and belief. It includes norms,
values, beliefs, myths, legends, literature, ritual, art forms and other intellectualliterary activities. The material and non-material aspects of any culture are usually
interdependent on each other.

•

Sometimes, however, material culture may change quickly but the non-material may
take longer time to change. This process of lagging behind of Non material culture
from Material culture is referred by William F Ogburn in his work Social Change
with Respect to Culture and Original Nature.

Cultural Lag
•

Cultural lag according to Ogburn refers to the imbalance in the rate and speed of
change between these two parts of culture. Changes are quick to take place in the
material culture. These in turn stimulate changes in the non-material culture. But the
nonmaterial culture may be slow to respond giving rise to a gap or a lag between the
material and non-material culture. This lag is called cultural lag. For example, a
good number of Indians have adopted western technology but they have not changes
their traditional beliefs, customs etc.

•

In popular parlance, the material aspects of culture, such as scientific and
technological achievements are seen as distinct from culture which is left with the
non-material, higher achievements of group life (art, music, literature, philosophy,
religion and science).

•

Culture is the product of such an organization and expresses itself through language
and art, philosophy and religion. It also expresses itself through social habits,
customs, economic organisations and political institutions.

•

“Culture” encompasses objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and
symbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life.

knowledge is referred to as the cognitive elements.

•

Beliefs-Every sect within a culture having some beliefs for cultural refuge. These
beliefs are responsible for the spiritual fulfilment of needs and wants. Beliefs in
empirical terms are neither true nor false for example-Sikh wear bangle in one hand,
keeping a dagger. The water of Ganga is sacred for Hindus.

•

Values and norms – Values may be defined as measures of goodness or desirability.
Anything getting importance in our daily life becomes our values. The origin of
values is not biological but it is social production while living in society and values
develop.

•

Symbols-Culture is system of symbols. Symbols are anything used to represent
express and stand for and event situation. Sign direct to guide our behaviour. It is
used to show an event of past, present or future. A number of invented or artificial
symbols are used in social life which assumes importance. Bowing head, whistling,
winkling of eyes situational are the symbols, which express a specific object idea
about other. For example flag, anthem, picture, statues are symbols.

•

Language- A group of words or ideas having common meaning and is shared to a
social situation Is called language. Language is the entrance to a culture. Language is
a source of communication and to transmit message from one person to another.
Language differs from culture to culture. Language is like vehicle through which we
can carry out our complex social activities.

Characteristics of culture
•

Culture is social: culture does not exist in isolation neither it is an individual
phenomenon. It is product of society. It originates and develops through social
interaction. It is shared by the member of society. Man becomes man only among
men.

•

Culture is learned behaviour: Culture is not inherited biologically but it is learnt
socially by a man in a society. It is not an in born tendency but acquired by man from
the association of other, e.g., drinking, eating, dressing, walking, behaving, reading

•

Culture is transmitted: Culture is capable of transmitted from one generation to next.
Parents pass on culture traits to their children and they in turn to their children and so
on. Culture is transmitted not through genes but by means of language. Language is
the main vehicle of culture.

satisfaction of our needs and desires. These needs may be biological or social in
nature but it is responsible for satisfy it. Our need for food, shelter and clothing and

desires are status, fame, money etc. are all for the examples which fulfilled according
to the cultural ways
•

Culture varies from society to society: Every society has its own culture and way of
behaving. It is not uniform. Every culture is unique in itself is a specific society. For
example values, customs, tradition, religion, belief are not uniform everywhere.

•

Culture is continuous and cumulative: Culture exists as a continuous process. Culture
is the memory of human race. Culture is not a matter of month or year. It is
continuous process and adding new cultural traits.

•

Culture is dynamic: It remains changing but not static. Cultural process undergoes
changes but with different speed from society to society and generation to generation.



Civilization has a precise standard of measurement but not culture
Example for civilization: Banking system is better than barter system
Example for culture: work of Kalidas is better than Shakespeare- cannot be compared

Example for civilization: Product of civilization – technical devices
Example for culture: Product of culture – foreigner following Indian culture is
difficult
Civilization is external, but culture is internal
Example for civilization: material wealth of mankind
Example for culture: refers to intrinsic values
Culture and Heritage
Cultural development is a historical process. Our ancestors learnt many things from
their predecessors. With the passage of time they also added to it from their own
experience and gave up those which they did not consider useful.





The culture inherited from our predecessors is called our cultural heritage. This
heritage exists at various levels.
Humanity as a whole has inherited a culture which may be called human cultural
heritage
A nation also includes a culture which may be termed as national cultural heritage.
Cultural heritage includes all those aspects or values of culture transmitted to human
beings by their ancestors from generation to generation. They are cherished, protected
and maintained by them with unbroken continuity and they feel proud of it. A few
examples would be helpful in clarifying the concept of heritage- Taj Mahal.
How important is this culture for the Human life






Culture is closely linked with life, without culture, there would be no humans.
Culture is made up of traditions, beliefs, and way of life, from the most spiritual to
the most material.
A fundamental element of culture is the issue of religious belief and its symbolic
expression.
Valuing religious identity and be aware of current efforts to make progress in terms of
interfaith dialogue, which is actually an intercultural dialogue.
The need for coexistence makes the coexistence of cultures and beliefs necessary.



The three eternal and universal values of truth, beauty and goodness is closely
linked with culture.
It is culture that brings us closer to truth through philosophy and religion; it
brings beauty in our lives through the arts and makes us aesthetic beings.
It is culture that makes us ethical beings by bringing us closer to other human beings
and teaching us the values of love, tolerance and peace.

their own ways are preserving, promoting and disseminating India’s vast
cultural heritage.

Thank you Learners

Hello learners. Welcome to the Indian Culture – part 2 session.
You learned about culture, its qualities, and its significance in the last session.
In this chapter, we'll look at how culture has changed over time.
The emphasis will be on Indian culture across the ages of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India.
Introduction to Culture
Culture is a way of life for many people. Culture includes the foods you consume, the clothes you
wear, the language you speak, and the God you serve. In short, culture is the embodiment of the way
we think and act.
Looking at the map of India we can see the diversity in social and environmental life.
Diversities are seen in speaking different languages, following different religious practices and
rituals, food habits, dress patterns, music, dance, etc.
The distinct traits of Indian culture have been well-regarded from ancient times and are being
followed now.
Culture in Ancient India
We will now have a look at the culture from Ancient India.
Let me post a question?
Do you believe that Indian culture has remained consistent throughout history?
The answer is “NO”
It has gone through numerous changes.
Any idea, how these changes have taken place?
This is because every dynasty, every invader that comes to the land and settles leaves their imprint on
the culture.
Harappan Civilization
Let’s start with the Harappan civilization.
Indus Valley Civilization also known as Harappan Civilization is an ancient Indian civilization that
flourished more than 4000 years ago in the north-western parts of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent.
It derived its name from the River Indus, which is the main river of the region.
Harappan Civilization is known for urban culture in India.
Agriculture was the main occupation of the Harappans who were living in rural areas.
The transition from rural to urban life took place through remarkable features of Harappan culture.
Here are some of the features of Harappan culture.
Great cities emerged.
They built double storied houses of burnt bricks with a bathroom, a kitchen and a well.
Underground drainage system connecting all houses to the street drains which were covered by
stones or bricks.
Cooking was done in the courtyard.
Women were given respect and treated equally.

Harappan civilization is based on archaeological evidence alone.
Knowledge on personal hygiene.
Worshipped trees and animals.
Believed in ghosts and evil forces and used amulets as protection against the evil spirits.
Slowly, the Harappan culture started declining and there is no evidence of its deterioration.
Aryan Culture
A new culture flourished in the same known as the Aryan culture.
There were significant differences between this culture and the culture which preceded it.
Aryans settled along the banks of the Indus which is Sindhu and Saraswati now extinct rivers.
They wrote hymns in praise of the gods and goddesses they worshipped.
The Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda were the four Vedas that compiled these
hymns.
The Aryans had a major influence on Indian culture in 3 major areas:
Religion: Hinduism
The Aryans carried with them a religion known as Vedism.
This Vedism meshed with the Harappa culture to give a history to the Vedic period.
This Vedic period saw the inception of what has come to be known as Hinduism, one of the largest
religions in today's world.
Written language: Sanskrit
Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, the most ancient Hindu script.
Social Structure: Caste system
According to the social-historical theory, the origin of caste system finds its origin in the arrival
of Aryans in India. The four primary castes are Brahmin, the priests; Kshatriya, warriors and
nobility; Vaisya, farmers, traders, and artisans; and Shudra, tenant farmers and servants.
Some people were born outside of and below the caste system; they were called "untouchables"
or Dalits—"the crushed ones.“
This culture was patriarchal in nature.
Men in the family were given power and women lost their political rights.
Women cannot own property.
Child marriage was not prevented, and women’s remarriage was not allowed.
Over a period, Aryan culture merged with the local culture.
Education was given to the upper caste.
Gurukula was famous where pupils stayed with their teachers at gurukula.
Women were not allowed or sent to gurukula.
Religious sacrifice was given importance.
The priesthood became a profession and a hereditary one.

Domination of priests, against sacrifices and rituals, led to the rise of Jainism and Buddhism to
protect against the prevailing Hinduism.
Ancient India
This period of ancient India ended with the rise of the Mauryan empire.
Inscriptions and coins are important sources of information for understanding the early history of
Indian culture.
Archaeology as a source of information yielded considerable data on the material cultures of the
Ganga valley.
The Gupta era is often regarded as the high point of Ancient Indian culture called “a golden age” –
few mentioned this as a period of renaissance.
It was a period of great achievements in art, literature, and science.
It was also a time of transition, as Indian culture progressed from its ancient form to its more modern
one.
India has a stunning culture that astounds visitors from all over the world.
People have admired India's culture for thousands of years.
The culture of ancient India is incredibly diverse and rich.
Medieval Period in India
Let’s now look at the Medieval period in India.
Developments in the field of religion, folk art, and language in India during the medieval times have
been important milestones in the evolution of the composite culture of India.
The composite cultural characteristic of the medieval period is amply witnessed in these fields.
A new style of architecture known as the Indo- Islamic style was born out of this fusion.
The distinctive features of Indo-Islamic architecture were the dome, lofty towers or minarets, arch, and
vault.
The medieval Indian culture represents the synthesis of Indian and Persian philosophy, literature, art,
and architecture.
In the religious sphere, Sufism and Bhakti traditions influenced each other. They provided an
opportunity for understanding the religious traditions of Hindus and Muslims at the people’s level.
The emergence of Urdu as a new language is the best example of interaction and synthesis.
The medieval period represents an important era of dramatic change in the world of religion and art in
South Asia.
The growing popularity of Sufism played an important role in the popular acceptability of Islam and in
the course of establishing unique Islamic traditions in the subcontinent.
Islam had a great influence on Indian society.
There were two important religious movements during this period – The Sufi and the Bhakti
movements.
The Sufis with their attitude of piety, tolerance, sympathy, and concept of equality had a deep impact
on the Indian people.

The Bhakti movement played a similar role in the development of Hinduism.
Another important development during the medieval period was the growth in vernacular literature.
Growing regional identities helped create new literary and art forms.
The growth in regional languages like Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi and Telugu was a very significant
development.
The popularity of translations further widened readership and helped in the exchange of ideas.
During this period, two new religious faiths flourished in India. They were Sikhism and Zoroastrianism.
The exchange of ideas also ushered in the new development in music.
The use of the Sitar and new styles of music further enriched the medieval period.
In the realm of art, one witnesses the development of new styles of painting associated with the
patronage of the Mughal and the Rajput style.
There was a change in the character and stylistic
representation.
The synthesis of the medieval period is best seen in the development of new architectural styles.
Many forts, palaces, temples and Mosques can be dated to this period are examples of the new styles.
The use of decorative motifs and the adaptation of the dome are examples of the architectural traditions
of this period.
The Cholas conquered parts of Bengal and Indonesia. They introduced democratic institutions at the
village level. In the Cholamandalam region, the Tamil language was popular.
On the political front, the thirteenth to sixteenth century saw the decline of an all-powerful state and the
rise of a number of provincial and regional states.
The increase in commerce can be seen in the increase of coinage as a result of the transfer of stored
silver and gold into minted money.
The cultural stream in India continued to assimilate all the newcomers and the resulting cultural
interaction gave Indian culture its characteristic of being multidimensional, multilingual, multireligious
and yet composite in nature.

Modern India
India is a fascinating country that has intrigued Westerners for millennia.
Spices, rich stones, and enigmatic architecture have all come from this area. It boasts a gorgeous and
culturally diverse culture.
Traditional Indian practices, British heritage, and various modern influences from throughout the world
combine to form modern Indian culture.
Language- Hindi and English are the two official languages. However, because they are not spoken by
everyone, over 20 other languages have been given official status. There are about 1,000 dialects
spoken in the area.

Religion- A large number of the population follows Hinduism. About 80 per cent of the population are
Hindus. This faith is a blend of several religious ideas and traditions that is widely seen as a way of life.
Islam is the world's second most popular religion, with Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, Christianity, and
other faiths.
Festivals- There is no definitive list of Indian festivals because the country celebrates over 50 festivals
by people of various cultures and religions. Indian festivals are an important element of the country's
rich cultural legacy.
Family- Family structure is changing from joint family culture to nuclear families.
Food - Indian cuisine has gained international recognition. India's cuisine is recognised for its spiciness.
Spices are abundantly used in Indian cuisine, whether in North or South India.
Clothing- In India, modern clothing incorporates both western and indigenous aspects. Many women
also wear a bindi (a colourful dot in the centre of the forehead), and they frequently wear jewellery and
makeup. Traditional henna tattoos are still a popular kind of body art for special occasions.
Social stratification - In India, caste is one of the most essential sets of role cards and still exists.
The most important feature is Urban India and Rural India.
Urban India is the India of modern industry, national politics and foreign policy, government planning,
the national media, the major universities, business, the armed forces, science and technology. Its best
products are frequently as good as the best in the world, its orientation is cosmopolitan.
Rural India is the India of age-old patterns where tradition is the principal dynamic of society, where
outsiders come and go but life continues, often without much change.
When urban and rural India are united, by extending education, reducing illiteracy, improving the
average lifespan, introducing some basic health care, and maintaining a democratic government system,
India would be a flourishing country.
Unity in diversity is one of the major characteristics of Indian culture which makes it unique.
A synthesis of various cultures came about through the ages to give shape to what is recognised as
Indian culture today.
Spirituality and a value-based lifestyle is the core of Indian culture.
The culture of India is the living expression of the simplicity and profundity of the people.
Thus, the distinctive features of Indian culture and its uniqueness are the precious possession of all
Indians

With this, we come to the end of our session. In today’s session, we discussed the culture of
Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India.
I hope you would have got a fair understanding of Indian Culture.
Thank you and Happy Learning!

Welcome to the today’s session on Famous culture in India
Every state in India is a "Unity in Diversity," with its own unique cultural heritage
and traditions. Every region of India has its own unique traditions, food, philosophy,
language, and customs.
Thus, Indian culture and tradition are a synthesis of the cultures of various states that
have been woven together. Let's examine the various cultural traditions of India's .
Let's travel from the North to the South and see what each state has to offer.
Greetings:

The Namaste greeting, also known as namaskar or namaskaram, which translates
to "I bow to the divine in you," is one of the most well-known customs and
traditions in Indian culture.

The hand motion is made by making a small bow and placing the palms together
in prayer position in front of the chest.

Another well-known proverb is "Atithi Devo Bhava," which translates to "the
guest is equivalent to god" and is found in Hindu scriptures.

Guests have always been given the utmost importance in Indian culture.

Also come across the Indian head shake, which, depending on the context of the
conversation, can signify yes, thank you, or understanding.
Families:
In India, a joint family is one in which all members—which may occasionally include
parents, wives, kids, and distant relatives—reside together.
A "Karta" serves as the family's head and is a senior male or female who makes
financial and social decisions on the group's behalf. Other relationships may be equal,
based on respect, or teasing in nature.
All members gain from the income that goes into a communal pot.
Nowadays, nuclear-like families are more prevalent than joint families due to
economic growth and urbanisation.
Food:
Food is one of our favourite Indian cultural practises and traditions! In India, each
region has a unique cuisine with a signature dish or ingredient.
It's one of the top nations for vegetarian food, which is mainly served in Gujarat and
Rajasthan.
Bengali, Mughlai, North Indian, South Indian and Punjabi cuisine all heavily
emphasise non-vegetarian options, and Kerala in South India is renowned for its
mouthwatering fish dishes.
Plenty of fresh ingredients are always guaranteed, including wonderful herbs and
spices used for flavour, aroma, to enhance colours, and for medicinal purposes.
Religion:
India is a country where people of various religions live in peace with one another.
Hinduism, 14.2% Islam, 2.3% Christianity, 1.7% Sikhism, 0.7% Buddhism, and 0.4%
Jainism are practised by 79.8% of the population, respectively.
Hinduism holds the cow in high regard, and in mythology, many gods—including
Shiva riding his bull Nandi and the cowherd god Krishna—are shown to be
accompanied by cows.

The udder represents the four goals of life—desire, material wealth, righteousness,
and salvation—while the horns stand in for the gods, the four legs for the "Vedas"
(early Hindu scriptures).
Temple:
It's a magical experience to explore an Indian temple, but there are a few things to
keep in mind before you go.
Many of these sacred structures were purposefully erected in areas that were abundant
in the good energy produced by the Earth's magnetic wave lines.
The Garbhagriha or Moolasthan, a copper plate found beneath the main idol in most
temples, absorbs and resonates this subterranean energy.
Before entering a temple, one of the customs and traditions in Indian culture is to
take a bath or shower, or at the very least, wash your hands and feet to purify yourself
of evil spirits and negative thoughts.
Festival:
In India, there are hundreds of occasions to celebrate, so a new occasion occurs every
day.
The enormous variety of festivals, which include statewide, religious, and
community-based celebrations, showcase India's rich culture and traditions.
Hindus observe Diwali, Holi, and Makar Sakranti; Muslims celebrate Eid; Sikhs
celebrate Baisakhi (crop harvesting); Jains remember Mahavir Jayanti; and Buddhists
commemorate Buddha's birthday. Christians also observe Good Friday and Christmas.
Clothing:
In India, regional climate, cultural traditions, and ethnicity all affect clothing choices.
Clothing for men and women has developed from simple coverings for the body (such
as the sari, dhoti, gamcha, kaupina, langota, lungi, etc..) to elaborate costumes worn
for special occasions, rituals, and dance performances.
In urban areas, you'll see people from all social classes wearing western clothing.
Embroidery, embellishment, printing, and other fantastic skills that have been passed
down through the generations are frequently displayed in traditional Indian clothing.
Literature:
In the form of tales, poems, plays, and self-help manuals, India has produced a
number of great epics that date back many centuries.
The Ramayana and Mahabharata, two of the most well-known Hindu epics, both tell
thrilling tales of gods and demons, love and war, chariots and kidnappings.
These legends have been passed down through generations and are deeply ingrained
in Indian culture.
The Ramayana chronicles the fourteen-year exile to the forest that Rama underwent at
his father King Dasharatha's urging. Rama was the prince of the legendary kingdom
of Kosala.
The Mahabharata is the longest Sanskrit poem ever composed. Both epics depict the
triumph of good over evil as well as the virtues of fidelity, sacrifice, and honesty
Dance:
India offers a wide variety of dance forms which vary throughout each state.
The Hindu Sanskrit ‘Natyashashtra’ (text of performing arts) recognises eight Indian
classical dances, which includes Kathak in North, West and Central India, with East

India showcasing Sattriya from Assam, Manipuri from Manipur and Oddisi from
Odhisa.
In South India, you can witness the Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, Bharatnatyam in
Tamil Nadu, Kathakali and Mohiniyattam in Kerala.
The stories behind Indian folk dances are also passed down through the generations.
These dances are well-liked in rural areas, and performances depict village life.
Culture Of North Indian States
Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand,
and the two union territories of Delhi and Chandigarh are among the states in northern
India.
These states are home to the Himalayas, the tallest mountain in the world, as well as
the agriculturally productive Indo-Gangetic Plains. These areas have also been
invaded by Aryans, Huns, Greeks, and Afghans, and their tradition and culture are
linked to those of the Indo-Aryans.
The majority of north India is Hindu, but there is a stronger Muslim presence in
Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab has a Punjabi culture, and the entire region of north
India is influenced by the Mughal empire. Brahmins, Ahirs, Jats, Rajputs, Gurjars,
Khatris, Tarkhans, Kambojs, Banias, and Dalits make up the majority of the ethnic
groups in North India. Islam, Sikhism, and Hinduism.
The Taj Mahal and Harmandir Sahib are two examples of North India's cultural
heritage in architecture. Numerous holy religious sites, including Vaishno Devi,
Amarnath, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Haridwar, Varanasi, and Harmandir Sahib in
Amritsar, can be found in north India.
The high literacy works of Kalidasa were first written in North India, where he was
born.
The festivals observed in North India vary from one state to the next; in Punjab,
people celebrate Gurupurab, Hola Mohalla, and Baisakhi. Kashmir celebrates Sindhu
Darshan and Urs.
Himachal Pradesh celebrates Phulaich, and Kullu's Dushera is also very well-known.
In addition to the well-known festivals of Teej and Sanjhi in Haryana, Lathmar Holi
in Uttar Pradesh and the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, Dev Deepawali is celebrated in
Varanasi.
Uttar Pradesh celebrates Ramnavami and Janmashtami, while Uttaranchal celebrates
Mata Murti Ka Mela and Magh Mela.
North Indian men wear kurta pyjamas or dhotis and headgear like topis, turbans, or
pagri, while women dress in salwar kameez, sarees, and ghagra cholis.
In North India, wheat is the main food, and Roti is typically served with Sabzi. Nonvegetarian food is also widely available, particularly in Kashmir.
Hindustani classical music, which is popular in North India, was inspired by chants
used in Vedic rituals.
Each state has its own traditional dance, such as the Giddha and Bhangra of the
Punjab, the Kathak of Uttar Pradesh, the Rouf of Kashmir, and the Nati of Himachal
Pradesh.
Eg: Jammu and Kashmir

North Indian men wear kurta pyjamas or dhotis and headgear like topis, turbans, or
pagri, while women dress in salwar kameez, sarees, and ghagra cholis.
In North India, wheat is the main food, and Roti is typically served with Sabzi. Nonvegetarian food is also widely available, particularly in Kashmir.
Hindustani classical music, which is popular in North India, was inspired by chants
used in Vedic rituals.

Punjab, the Kathak of Uttar Pradesh, the Rouf of Kashmir, and the Nati of Himachal
Pradesh.
The embroidery and intricate designs on Jammu and Kashmiri costumes are well
known for reflecting the region's rich culture and landscape. The type of clothing is
intended to combat the area's chilly climate. The majority of clothing is made of
cotton, wool, and silk decorated with elaborate embroidery.
For Kashmiri women, the pheran is a common outfit. Women typically have Zari and
embroidery on the collar, hemline, and areas around the pockets of their pherans. In
the summer, women prefer a suit, while in the fall, they prefer Pheran.

traditions. Since the Dogras are Hindus, their diet consists primarily of rice, wheat,
and beans. They consume a lot of vegetables, but the hak or karam sag is the preferred
dish.
Kashmiri cuisine is primarily made of meat and is slow-cooked for a very long time
with numerous exotic spices. Kashmiris detest the use of intoxicating beverages
despite living in a cold country. Kahva, a traditional Kashmiri winter beverage, is a
green tea flavoured with spices and almonds. With a cup of "kahva," a Kashmiri meal
comes to an end.
Using traditional Central Asian instruments and musical scales, the music of the
Kashmiri Valley is more akin to Central Asian music than Jammu's music is to North
Indian music.
Men from the Wattal region dance the Dumhal, which is a well-known dance in the
Kashmir valley. The Rouff is another traditional folk dance that the women perform.
The most popular tourist destinations in Jammu and Kashmir are the Kashmir Valley,
Srinagar, the Mughal Gardens, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, and Jammu. Non-Indians must
obtain a special permit to enter certain areas.
The Kashmir valley's tourism industry suffered the most from the state's militancy.
The sacred sites in Jammu are still well-liked destinations for tourism and

Culture of Central Indian States

Module 5 Ancient fine arts of India are Painting, handicrafts, Indian classic music,
Dance and Drama

Hello Learners,
Today we are going learn about Ancient Fine arts of India
First let see on Indian Paintings
•

Of various art forms, painting has always been a very powerful medium of cultural
tradition and expression. It is associated with values, beliefs, behaviour of mankind
and provides material objects to understand people’s way of life, their thought process
and creativity.

•

In simple words, painting has become a bridge to our past, reflecting what people
think and want to depict. Painting is also a part of tangible material culture, where
human creations are termed as artifacts and helps in understanding the cultural values.
It is a human way of transforming elements of world into symbol, where each of it has
a distinct meaning and can also be manipulated.

•

Compared to sculpture, painting is easier to execute and that is why Stone Age people
chose it as an expression of their beliefs and imaginations. In fact, painting marks an
entirely new phase in the human history and is regarded as a giant cultural leap.
Ancient Indian Painting Tradition

•

Painting as an art form has flourished in India from very early times as is evident from
the remains that have been discovered in the caves, and the literary sources.

•

The history of art and painting in India begins with the pre-historic rock painting at
caves near (M.P.) where we have drawings and paintings of animals.

•

The cave paintings of (Maharashtra) show skins of spotted deer left drying.
Thousands of years ago, paintings and drawings had already appeared on the seals of
Harappan civilization.

•

The Buddhist text Vinayapitaka (4th–3rd century) describes the existence of painted
figures in many royal buildings. The play Mudrarakshasa (5th Century A.D.)
mentions numerous paintings or Patas. The 6th Century AD text on aestheticsKamasutra by Vatsyayana has mentioned painting amongst 64 kinds of arts and says
that it was based on scientific principles.

•

The best specimens of Gupta paintings are the ones at Ajanta. Their subject was
animals and birds, trees, flowers, human figures and stories from the Jataka.

•

Mural paintings are done on walls and rock surfaces like roofs and sides. Cave no. 9
depicts the Buddhist monks going towards a stupa. In cave no. 10 Jataka stories are
depicted. But the best paintings were done in the 5th – 6th centuries AD during the
Gupta age.

•

The murals chiefly depict religious scenes from the life of the Buddha and the
Buddhist Jataka stories but we also have secular scene. Here we see the depiction of
all aspects of Indian life.

•

We see princes in their palaces, ladies in their chambers, coolies with loads over their
shoulders, beggars, peasants and ascetics, together with all the many beasts, birds and
flowers of India.

•

In India both murals are painted on thin coat of limestone mixture dried with glue, and
frescoes are painted on wet lime plaster are found. It is also noticed that in ancient
times the colours used in these paintings are derived from natural organic pigments.

Classical paintings
•

One of the best examples of the Classical paintings is from the Ajanta Caves, painted
between circa 200 B.C. and A.D. 600 Ajanta has thirty-one Caves, built in two phases
– first one was around 2nd century B.C. and second was between 4th and 6th
centuries A.D. In both phases, the art was patronized by the Hindu rulers – the
Satvahanas (in the early period) and the Vakatakas (in the later period). The famous
Ajanta caves can be considered as ancient art galleries.

•

The Indian art has been inspired by spiritualism and mystical relationship between the
God and man. The earliest recorded art was inspired by religious Hindu background
and it was later replaced by the popular Buddhist art. The philosophy of aesthetics
was closely related to thoughts in the Upanishads and thus art played a very important
role in the Indian religious life. Inward vision, sense of great peace and tranquility –
are the hall marks of Indian art. The early caves of Ajanta are of the Hinayana order,
where the monks worshipped symbols such as stupa, wheel etc.

Painting in the post – classical period
•

While studying painting tradition of India, the contribution made by the south Indian
kingdoms of the Cholas, Vijaynagara and Nayakas cannot be ignored. In the Chola
temples there are many fresco paintings seen at Vijayala Colesvara temple at
Narttamalai (A.D. 1100), Brihadesvara temple at Tanjavur (A.D. 1100), Sangita –
Mandapa at Tiruparuttikunram in Kanchipuram (A.D. 1387-88 ) and Vcayapa Matha
at Angundi (about the same date). The Chola frescoes were first discovered in A.D.
1931 within the circumambulatory passage of Brihadeshvara temple

•

The Chola frescoes have ardent spirit of Saivism expressed in them. In all paintings,
Chola physiognomical and stylistic forms are apparent. The Classical values of full
roundedness of volume, subtle plasticity are also retained. But at the same time, there
is also strongly perceptible lessening of the consistency of colour modelling and
hence a flattening of surface is there, despite ample curves and colour.

•

During the Nayaka period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The latter paintings
belonging to the Vijaynagara period (the Lepakshi wall painting), show general
decline in the art style. Outline became sharper and dedicate modelling of earlier
period is absent.

Medieval Indian Painting
•

The advent of Islam and the spread of Islamic influence, initiated a new period in
Indian history ---the medieval period. It also had a direct impact on the realm of
painting.

•

The pattern of large-scale paintings, which had dominated the scene, were replaced
by the miniature painting during the 11th and 12th centuries A.D.

•

The miniature paintings are small paintings. They were often part of manuscripts
written at the time and illustrated the subjects of the manuscript. Thus, a new kind of
illustration was set during the period under review.

Mughal painting
•

Medieval painting is, largely represented by the Mughal School, which developed
during the period of the Mughal empire (16th -19th centuries A.D.). Renowned for
their brilliant colours, accuracy in line drawing, detailed realism, intricacy and variety
of themes – the Mughal paintings were a class by themselves.

•

It was distinct from all other styles and techniques of Pre- Mughal and Contemporary
art. Contrary to Delhi sultanate, the Mughal paintings were more popular and
widespread.

•

There were several factors responsible for it – urbanization, better administrative
system, exclusive patronage by the rulers and nobility, synthesis of cultural values and
tradition of Central Asia, integration of Mughal economy with world economy, etc. In
fact, painting became a widespread source of livelihood during the rule of Mughals.

•

The Mughal painting did not develop in vacuum. It had clear influence of different
tradition of contemporary world, namely, Persian, Timurid, Mongolid, Chinese and
European.

•

The diffusion of these styles with the indigenous style created a new living tradition
of painting, popularly known as Indo-Sino-Persian art. Initially, the Mughal style of
painting had dominant Mongolid characteristics but gradually the Mongolid elements
diminished and the Indian characteristics came to the forefront. Thus diffusion of
various styles led to creation of a new cultural element.

•

The Mughals used paintings as a tool of display of political power, imperial ideology,
authority, status and economic prosperity. The Mughal paintings were very rich in
variety- in terms of themes and colours. Some of the themes were- illustration of
battles, scenes from court life, wild life, hunting, portraits, etc. Rich use of colours
obtained from precious stones, metals like gold and silver-were also hallmark of the
Mughal paintings.

Modern Indian Painting

•

The decline of the Mughal Empire was accompanied by the control of English East
India Company in A.D. 1757 over north-eastern region, thus laying the foundation of
British Raj.

•

In the realm of art, Indian art gave into new fashion brought by the English. The art
was no longer confined to court but began to be taught and patronized by art schools,
art societies, etc.

•

The new landscape, unusual flora and fauna, stunning monuments, exotic new people
caught the attention of English travelers, Company Sahibs and Mem Sahibs. They
began to hire Indian painters in 18th and 19th centuries A.D. to capture the quaint
oriental images. Thus in the cities ruled by the English East India company, the
Company School of painting emerged under western influence.

•

The hub of Company paintings were centers like Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, Varanasi
and Patna, where either the English had a factory or commercial interest. Calcutta was
among the early major center of Company paintings.

•

The reaction to the Company School in the mid-19th century was two-fold. On one
hand Raja Ravi Varma adapted a distinct method to evolve a new style of painting of
Indian subjects whereas on the other hand the ‘Nationalist school’ represented by the
nationalist painter preferred to look at Indian themes and manifested it in the works of
the famous ‘Bengal School’.

Raja Ravi Varma (A.D. 1848-1906)
•

Raja Ravi Varma of royal family of Travancore received formal training in painting,
before entering the ‘low’ profession of paintings against his family’s objections. His
paintings were inspired by the Victorian art but were more akin to art form of the
royal court. Raja Ravi Varma achieved recognition for his depiction of the scenes
from the epics of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and thus rose to be a remarkable
portrait painter, prized by both, the Raj and the Indian elite.

•

His fusion of Indian tradition with the technique of European Academic art, created a
new cannon of beauty in which characters like Shakuntala, Damyanti, etc. were
portrayed shapely and gracefully.

•

His fusion of Indian tradition with the technique of European Academic art, created a
new cannon of beauty in which characters like Shakuntala, Damyanti, etc. were
portrayed shapely and gracefully.

•

Bengal School reflected nationalist fervours in the paintings and resistance to British
rule in their own way.

•

Various folk-art forms like Mithila paintings (Madhubani), Kalamkari painting, Warli
painting and Kalighat painting took Indian painting to new heights by adding new
dimensions to it.

region and style to style.
TYPES OF FOLK ART
1. Tanjore Art
Folk art is linked with the forgotten art of storytelling. Paintings are used to depict the
visual counterpoint in narration in every region of India.
Art forms of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bengal narrate the myths and legends of local
heroes and deities and construct a kaleidoscopic image of our glorious past and rich
cultural heritage.
Each work is a complete narration in itself, giving us a glimpse of the past, which has
been kept alive by talent and devotion of our artists.
2. Madhubani Painting
Madhubani painting, also referred to as Mithila Art (as it flourishes in the Mithila
region of Bihar), is characterized by line drawings filled in by bright colours and
contrasts or patterns.
This style of painting has been traditionally done by the women of the region, though
today men are also involved to meet the demand.
These paintings are popular because of their tribal motifs and use of bright earthy
colours.
These paintings are done with mineral pigments prepared by the artists. The work is
done on freshly plastered or a mud wall
Warli Folk Painting
Maharashtra is known for its Warli folk paintings. Warli is the name of the largest
tribe found on the northern outskirts of Mumbai, in Western India.

Despite being in such close proximity of the largest metropolis in India, Warli
tribesmen shun all influences of modern urbanization. Warli Art was first discovered
in the early seventies.
While there are no records of the exact origins of this art, its roots may be traced to as
early as the 10th century A.D.
Warli is the vivid expression of daily and social events of the Warli tribe of
Maharashtra, used by them to embellish the walls of village houses depicting
agriculture, hunting, fishing, etc. geometric pattern are used.
This was the only means of transmitting folklore to a populace not acquainted with
the written word. This art form is simple in comparison to the vibrant paintings of
Madhubani
Attachitra Painting:
Pattachitra style of painting is one of the oldest and most popular art forms of Odisha.
The name Pattachitra has evolved from the Sanskrit words patta, meaning canvas, and
chitra, meaning picture.
Pattachitra is thus a painting done on canvas, and is manifested by rich colourful
application, creative motifs and designs, and portrayal of simple themes, mostly
mythological in depiction.
Some of the popular themes represented through this art form are ThiaBadhia depiction of the temple of Jagannath; Krishna Lila - enactment of Jagannath as Lord
Krishna displaying his powers as a child;
Dasabatara Patti - the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu; Panchamukhi - depiction of
Lord Ganesh as a five headed deity
Rajasthani Miniature Painting
The art of Miniature painting was introduced to the land of India by the Mughals, who
brought the much-revealed art form from Persia.
In the sixteenth century, the Mughal ruler Humayun brought artists from Persia, who
specialized in miniature painting.
The succeeding Mughal Emperor, Akbar built an atelier for them to promote the rich
art form. These artists, on their part, trained Indian artists who produced paintings in a
new distinctive style, inspired by the royal and romantic lives of the Mughals.
The particular miniature produced by Indian artists in their own style is known as
Rajput or Rajasthani miniature.
During this time, several schools of painting evolved, such as Mewar (Udaipur),
Bundi, Kotah, Marwar (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Jaipur, and Kishangarh.

Kalamezhuthu
Names like Rangoli, Kolametc are not new to us, and neither is the tradition of
drawing them at the entrance of homes and temples.
In fact it is part of the domestic routine in Hindu households, who consider it
auspicious to draw certain patterns at the doorstep and courtyard to welcome a deity
into the house.
This art form is a harmonious blend of Aryan, Dravidian and Tribal traditions.Kalam
(Kalamezhuthu) is unique form of this art found in Kerala.
It is essentially a ritualistic art practiced in temples and sacred groves of Kerala where
the representation of deities like Kali and Lord Ayyappa, are made on the floor.

Hello Learners,
Today we are going learn about Indian Handicrafts
•

India is a virtual treasure house of the most exquisite handicrafts

•

Simple objects of daily life have been crafted with delicate design which give
expression to the creativity of the Indian artisan

•

Every state of India can boast of some unique creation which is special to the region,
for example,

•

Kashmir is famous for embroidered shawls, carpets, namdar silk and walnut wood
furniture. Rajasthan is famous for its tie-and-dye (bandhnï) fabrics,jewellery, using
precious stone and jems, blue glazed pottery and minakari work. Andhra Pradesh is
famous for Bidri work and Pochampalh saris while Tamil Nadu is well known for
bronze sculpture and Kajeevaram silk saris. Mysore is well known for silk,
sandalwood items and Kerala is famous for ivory carvings and rosewood furniture.
Chanderi and kosa silk of Madhya Pradesh, chikan work of Lucknow, Brocade and
silk saris of Benaras, cane furniture and goods of Assam, Bankura terracotta
modelling and handloom items of Bengal are just a few examples of unique
traditional decorative arts and crafts which constitute the heritage of modern India.
These arts have been nurtured for thousands of years and provided employment to a
great number of artisans who carried forward the art to the next generation. Thus, you
see how the Indian artisans with their magic touch can transform a piece of metal,
wood or ivory into objects of art.

THANK YOU LEARNERS

HAPPY LEARNING

Hello learners. Welcome to the module on Indian languages.
In this chapter, we'll introduce Indian Languages and Literature, the role of Sanskrit,
and the significance of scriptures to current society.
Introduction to Indian Languages
Indian languages are languages spoken in India that are classed as Indo-European
particularly the Indo-Iranian branch, Dravidian, Austroasiatic particularly Munda,
and Sino-Tibetan Tibeto-Burman in particular.
Assamese, Bengali or Bangla, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili,
Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Urdu are all members of the
Indo-Aryan group of Indo-Iranian languages.
The Dravidian language family includes Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.
The Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family includes Manipuri
or Meitei spoken in Manipur and Bodo spoken in northeastern India. The Munda
language family includes Santali.
Except for the Khasian languages spoken in Meghalaya, northeastern India, and the
Nicobarese languages spoken in the Nicobar Islands in the Andaman Sea, just to the
northwest of the Indonesian island of Sumatra—both of which are classified as part
of the Mon-Khmer subfamily of Austroasiatic—the other Austronesian languages
are spoken in Southeast Asia.
The Indo-Aryan languages, which are spoken by 78.05 percent of Indians, belong to
multiple linguistic families.
Dravidian languages are spoken by 19.64% of Indians, and both groups are
frequently referred to as Indic languages.

The remaining 2.31 percent of the population speaks Austroasiatic, Sino–Tibetan,
and Tai–Kadai languages.
According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599
other languages.
India has 22 major languages with approximately 720 dialects written in 13 distinct
scripts.
The official languages of India are Hindi which has 420 million speakers and
English which is also widely spoken.
The census of 2011 acknowledges 1369 rationalised mother tongues and 1474
names that were handled as 'unclassified' and consigned to the 'other' mother tongue
category out of 19,569 raw linguistic connections.

Introduction to Literature

Literature is a broad term that refers to any collection of written material, but it is also
used to refer to writings that are considered to be art forms, such as prose fiction,
drama, and poetry.
The term has broadened in recent decades to include oral literature, most of which has
been transcribed.
Literature can have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political purpose in addition
to recording, preserving, and transferring knowledge and amusement.
Nonfiction genres such as biography, diaries, memoir, correspondence, and the essay
can all be considered part of literature as an art form.
Nonfictional books, articles, and other printed information on a particular subject are
included in the broad definition of literature.
The name comes from the Latin literatura/litteratura, which means "learning, writing,
grammar," and was originally "writing produced with letters," from litera/littera,
which means "letter."
In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts.
Print technological advancements have enabled an ever-increasing diffusion and
proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature.
Literature helps us to travel through time and learn about life on the planet from those
who came before us.
It can have a deeper understanding of and appreciation for different cultures. It can
help us to learn about history through the ways it is documented, such as manuscripts
and oral history.
Literature serves as an enormous information base.
Great inventors' research papers and literary works by famous scientists frequently tell
anecdotes about their significant discoveries and inferences.
Current scientific and technological developments are chronicled so that the rest of
the world is aware of them.
Several ancient scriptures presenting accounts of human evolution and narratives of
human life in those times have proven to be extremely beneficial to humanity.
As a result, literature has always been a reliable source of information.
Sanskrit
Sanskrit is considered the oldest language in Hinduism, having been used by the
Hindu Celestial Gods for communication and dialogue, and then by the Indo-Aryans.

In Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, Sanskrit is commonly used. The title 'Sanskrit'
comes from the combination of the prefix 'Sam' meaning 'samyak,' which means
'completely,' and 'krit,' which means 'done.'
Thus, the name denotes communicating, reading, listening, and the use of vocabulary
to transcend and communicate an emotion that is totally or entirely done.
Despite being an extremely complicated language with a large vocabulary, it is still
frequently used in the reading of sacred books and hymns today
In Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, the Sanskrit language has long been
the primary medium of communication.
Sanskrit literature has a long history of use in ancient poetry, drama, science, and
religious and philosophical books.
Let’s now look at the role of Sanskrit.
Many Indian languages have their roots in Sanskrit. Sanskrit is used to write the
Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and Dharmasutras.
A wide range of secular and regional literature is also available. We will be able to
better comprehend our civilization and appreciate the diversity and complexity of our
culture by reading about the languages and literature developed in the past.
Our country's most ancient language is Sanskrit. It is one of the Indian Constitution's
twenty-two official languages.
Sanskrit is maybe the only language that has crossed geographical and cultural
boundaries.
There is no portion of India that has not contributed to or been touched by this
language, from north to south and east to west.
Kalidasa's writings have added to the treasury of Sanskrit writings' beauty.
Significance of Scriptures to the Current Society
Scriptures from the Latin Scriptura, which means "writing" are sacred texts that serve
a range of roles in a religious tradition's individual and collective existence.
Scriptures can be utilised to generate a deeper relationship with the divine,
communicate spiritual truths, foster collective identity, and guide individual and
communal spiritual practice.
The study of Scripture has become an intellectual pursuit in modern times.
Sacred texts from different civilizations are increasingly being studied in academic
settings, mostly to improve understanding of other cultures, whether ancient or
modern.
Even for casual readers, the easy accessibility to scriptures from all faith traditions has
aided mutual understanding and appreciation for the importance of all religions.

Spiritual searchers of all faiths can discover guidance throughout the world's
scriptures to help them on their way.
Scripture plays a range of aspects in a religious community's spiritual life.
In a religion, scripture serves three purposes: personal direction and inspiration,
collective
worship and instruction, and bibliomancy using scripture for magical purposes.
For many years, restricted literacy and crude copying methods impeded the general
circulation of religious books, but scripture has always had a personal dimension—at
least for those who have access to it.
With the advancement of literacy and the invention of printing and
telecommunications, many people can now personally encounter the scriptures from
their own faiths.
The Internet, television, and computers have altered the way and frequency with
which information, especially scriptures, is shared.
Most religious books and masterpieces from throughout the world have been archived
electronically on the Internet and are available to read in a variety of languages.
Conclusion
Language is what allows people to express things, thoughts, and attitudes in a
comprehensible manner and to communicate the results to others.
India has always been a country with many different countries and languages. India,
being a civilisation state, has a vast linguistic diversity, with hundreds of languages
spoken even today.
Modern India gives the right representation in the constitution, respecting the opinions
of people of different languages.

With this, we come to the end of our session. In today’s session, we discussed Indian
Languages and Literature, the role of Sanskrit, and the significance of scriptures to
current society.
I hope you would have got a fair understanding of Indian Languages.
Thank you and Happy Learning!

Hello everyone,
Today in this session, we will discuss on the Other Sanskrit literature
Development of Sanskrit literature
The

development

of

Sanskrit

grammar

began

with Panini in 400

BC with

his

book Asthadhyayi being the oldest book in Sanskrit grammar.The chaste form of Sanskrit
developed between 300 to 200 BC and was a refined version of Vedic Sanskrit.The first
evidence of the use of Sanskrit can be found in the inscriptions of Rudradaman at
Junagarh in the present Southern Gujarat region. However, The Gupta period when the use
of Sanskrit in poetries can be traced. This is totally a period of creation of pure literature
which is evident in works such as Mahakavyas ( epics ) and Khandakavyas (semi-epics).In
the field of Sanskrit literature, The Gupta period is known as the period of unique creation
because a variety of literary works developed during this reign. Another important aspect of it
is related to the ornate style in literary works. Many of the plays developed during the Gupta
period were also written in Sanskrit. However, it is to be noted that one of the features of
these plays was the use of Sanskrit language by the characters of high varna and the use of
Prakrit language by women and Shudras.
Classical Sanskrit Literature
•

Most of the literature in Sanskrit has been divided into the Vedic and Classical
categories.

•

The two epics: Mahabharata and Ramayana are also part of the classical category.
Irrespective of their centrality to the Hindu religion, these epics can also be
considered to be the pre-cursors of Sanskrit Kavya ( epic poetry ), nataka ( classical
drama ), and other treatises on medicine, statecraft, grammar, astronomy,
mathematics, etc.

•

Most of this Sanskrit literature was bound by the rules of grammar that have been
explained brilliantly in Panini’s Ashtadhyayi, a treatise on the rigid rules which bind
the Sanskrit language.

Ashtadhyayi:
•

The only surviving foundational and analytical source of Sanskrit grammar,
Ashtadhyayi (literally, “eight chapters”), was written by Panini and is believed to
have been published in the 4th century BCE.

•

Despite the fact that India has more than 5000 spoken languages, everyone agrees that
Sanskrit is the only sacred language and the source of all known sacred literature. The
standardization of the language, which is still used in various forms now, was done by
Panini.

Sanskrit Drama
•

One of the most popular genres of lyric poetry and prose is the popular romantic tales
whose sole purpose was to entertain the public or Lokaranjana.

•

These were usually written in the form of stories and yet they gave a unique
perspective on life. These were usually written in the form of elaborate dramas.

•

The rules regarding performance, acting, gestures, stage direction, and acting have
been illustrated in the Natyashastra by Bharata.

•

Major dramas written during the ancient period are:

•

Malavikagnimitra-The love story of the maiden of Queen and Agnimitra the son of
Pushyamitra Shunga.

•

Kalidasa-Vikramorvasiya-The love story of Vikram and Urvasi.

•

Abhigyana Shakunthalam-The recognition of Shakuntala.

•

Sudraka-Mricchakatika (The little clay cart)-The love story of young brahmin
Charudatta with a wealthy courtesan.

•

Vishakadatta-Mudrarakshasa-Devi Chandraguptam-Is a political drama and
narrates the ascent of king Chandragupta Maurya to power in India-

•

Bhavabhutti-Uttara Ramacharitham (The latter life of Rama)-It was written in
700 AD.

•

Bhasa-Swapnavasavadatta (Vasavadatta in dream)-Pancharatra-Urubhanga (story
of Dhuryodhana during and after his fight with Bhima).

•

Ratnavalli-About the love story of princess Ratnavalli, daughter of the King of
Ceylon and King Udayana. The mention of the celebration of Holi for the first time
can be found here.

•

Harshavardhana-Naganandha -Story of how Prince Jimutavahana gives up his
own body to stop a sacrifice of serpents to the divine Garuda. One unique character in
this drama is an invocation to Lord Budha in the Nandi verse.

•

Priyadarsika-Union of Udayana and Priyadarsika, daughter of king Dritavarman.

Sanskrit Poetry
•

This genre is also called Kavya or poetry.

•

Unlike the drama section where the story is the main focus of the text, poetry
concentrates more on the form, style, figure of speech, etc.

•

One of the greatest Sanskrit poets is Kalidasa who wrote Kumarasambhava ( the
birth of Kumar or Kariya, the son of Shiva and Parvati ), and Raghuvamsa ( the
dynasty of the Raghus ).

•

He also wrote two smaller epics called Meghaduta ( the cloud messenger )
and Ritusamhara

( medley of seasons ).
•

One should not forget to mention the contribution of poets like Harisena who wrote
during the Gupta period.

•

He wrote several poems in praise of the valor of Samudra Gupta and it was so well
appreciated that it was inscribed on the Allahabad pillar.

•

Another extremely popular Sanskrit poet was Jayadeva who wrote Gita Govinda in
the 12th century. It concentrates on the life and escapades of Lord Krishna. The text
combines elements of devotion to Lord Krishna, his love for Radha, and the beauty of
nature.

•

Other major poems are Kiratarjuniya written by Bharavi in 6 th century AD
and Sishupalavadha written by Magha in 7 th century AD.

•

Other Major Sanskrit texts

•

Several books were written about the sciences and state governance in Sanskrit.

•

Dharmasutras:

•

Historians argue that between 500 to 200 BC, several major books on law were
written and compiled, which are called the Dharmasutras. These were compiled
alongside the smritis that are known as Dharmashastras.

•

These are the basis of the laws governing the subjects of most of the Hindu kingdoms.
These not only elucidate the rules according to which property could be held, sold, or
transferred but also elaborate on the punishments for offenses ranging from fraud to
murder.

•

Manusmriti ( laws of Manu ):

•

Which defines the role of men and women in society, their interaction at a social
plane, and the code of conduct that they were supposed to follow. The Manusmriti
might have been written and compiled between 200 BC and 200 AD.

•

Arthashastra:

•

One of the most famous texts about statecraft from the Mauryan period is Kautilya’s
Arthashastra.

•

It concentrates on the economic and social conditions of the Mauryan empire.

•

The due focus was also given to the military strategy which should be employed by
the State.

•

The text mentions that ‘ Kautilya ‘ or ‘ Vishnugupta ‘ wrote it. Historians argue both
these names were an alias for Chanakya who was a learned scholar at the court of
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.

•

While Sanskrit was the preferred language of the courts in the ancient period, it got an
impetus in the Gupta period, which employed many great poets, dramatists, and
scholars of various subjects. In this period Sanskrit became the preferred language of
communication of cultured and educated people.

•

Scientific texts in Sanskrit

•

Pingala

•

Charak

•

Chandasastra (Book on mathematics)

•

Charak Samhitha (Book on
medicine)

•

Sushrutha

•

Madhava

•

Varahamihira

•

Aryabhata

•

Lagadha

•

Sushrutha Samhitha (Book on
surgery)

•

Madhava Nidana (Book on
Pathology)

•

Pancha Sidhantika (Book on
mathematical astronomy)

•

Brihat Samhitha (Book on wideranging subjects like planetary
movements, geology, architecture
etc.)

•

Aryabhatiya (Book on astronomy
and mathematics)

•

Vedanga Jyotisha

Conclusion
•

Sanskrit has a long and revered history that is commonly linked to worship and
devotion. It started out as a Vedic language, and it has been modified over time as a
result of different interpretations, precise grammar, and the complexity of its
application.

•

Which many people have shied away from because of its indomitable scope and
depth.

•

Many ancient books and manuscripts are translated from Sanskrit today despite its
extensive vocabulary and complex grammar and prose because no other language can
offer such a lavish literary grasp of the past while yet acting as a vehicle for faultless
human expression.

3.2 Indian Philosophy
Hello everyone,
Today in this session, we will discuss on the great Epics of our country, Ramayana and
Mahabaratha
•

Our two great epics are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The Ramayana of
Valmiki is the original Ramayana. It is called Adikavya and Maharishi Valmiki is
known as Adi Kavi. The Ramayana presents a picture of an ideal society.

•

The other epic, the Mahabharata, was written by Ved Vyas. Originally, it was written
in Sanskrit and contained 8800 verses and was called “Jaya” or the collection dealing
with victory.

•

These were raised to 24,000 and came to be known as Bharata, named after one of the
earliest Vedic tribes. The final compilation brought the verses to 100,000, which came
to be known as the Mahabharata or the Satasahasri Samhita. It contains narrative,
descriptive and didactic material, relating to conflict between the Kauravas and the
Pandavas.

•

The Mahabharata and the Ramayana have several renderings in different Indian
languages. The Mahabharata contains the famous Bhagavad Gita which contains the
essence of divine wisdom and is truly a universal gospel.

•

Though it is a very ancient scripture, its fundamental teachings are in use even today.

languages. The Mahabharata contains the famous Bhagavad Gita which contains the
essence of divine wisdom and is truly a universal gospel.

•

Though it is a very ancient scripture, its fundamental teachings are in use even today.

Let’s see the significance of these epics one after other
•

The characteristics of Hinduism, as just set forth, are best reflected in the BhagavadGita which may, indeed, be regarded as the principal scripture of this new religious
ideology.

•

They are also reflected in the character of Krsna, its enunciator, as portrayed in the
great epic, the Mahabharata

•

Mahabaratha and its Reference with 4 purusharthas.
The four purusharthas are Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

•

Mahabaratha, as an epic, Its vastness is aptly matched by the encyclopaedic nature of
its contents and the universality of its appeal.

•

The claim is traditionally made, and fully justified, that in matters pertaining to
dharma (religion and ethics), artha (material progress and prosperity), kama
(enjoyment of the pleasures of personal and social life), and moksa (spiritual
emancipation), whatever is found in this epic may be found elsewhere; but what is not
found in it will be impossible to find anywhere else.

•

The Mahabharata, which must have assumed its present form in the first centuries
before and after Christ, is traditionally believed to consist of 100,000 stanzas divided
into eighteen parvans.

•

The kernel of the Mahabharata story is briefly this:

•

The Pandavas, headed by Yudhisthira, and the Kauravas, headed by Duryodhana,
descended from common ancestors.

•

Duryodhana becomes jealous and, coveting the crown invites Yudhisthira to a game
of dice.

•

As the result of a rash wager, Yudhisthira loses his kingdom to Duryodhana and is
then forced to go into exile, together with his brothers and DraupadJ, the common
consort of the Pandavas, for twelve years, followed by one year during which they
must live incognito.

•

But even when the stipulated period is over, Duryodhana refuses to give even a
fraction of his territory to Yudhisthira, the rightful owner.

•

A grim battle ensues. The Kauravas are routed and ruined, and the Pandavas regain
their lost kingdom.

•

•

In the Bhagvad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince and
elaborates
on different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies with examples and analogies.

•

This makes Gita a concise guide to Hindu philosophy and a parochial, self-contained
guide to life.

•

In modern times Swami Vivekananda, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi and
many others used the text to help inspire the Indian independence movement.

•

This was mainly because the Bhagvad Gita spoke of positiveness in human actions. It
also spoke of duty towards God and human beings alike forgetting about the results.

•

You will appreciate the fact that the Gita has been translated nearly in all the main
langauges of the world

Ramayana
•

If the Mahabharata (with the Harivamsa) glorifies the Krsna incarnation, the other
epic, the Ramayana, gives an account of the Rama incarnation.

•

This incarnation is traditionally believed to have been earlier than the Krsna
incarnation; composition of the Ramayana, however, which is largely the work of a
single poet named Valmiki, seems to have begun after that of the Mahabharata, but
ended before the Mahabharata assumed its final form

•

It has seven kandas-the entire seventh kanda evidently is a later interpolation. It
contains several sections of religious significance, such as the Surya-stava (which is
also called Aditya-hrdaya- stotra) by Agastya and the Rama-stuti by Brahma (both in
the Yuddha-kanda).

•

Its principal religious appeal, however, springs from the idealized domestic and social
virtues which its characters embody. Indeed, this appeal has, through the centuries,
proved to be direct and sustained

•

Dasaratha, king of Ayodhya, is about to install his eldest son, Rama, on the throne.

•

Kaikeyi, Rama’s step-mother, wants her own son Bharata to be crowned king, and
Rama to be sent into exile for fourteen years.

•

The old and infirm king, though reluctant, has to agree.

•

Rama goes to live in the forest, accompanied by his consort, Sita, and his brother,
Laksmana.

•

The demon-king of Lanka, Ravana, abducts Sita.

•

Rama, determined to rescue Sita, wages a dour war against Ravana who is ultimately
vanquished and killed.

•

Rama comcs back to Ayodhya and assumes his position as king, with Slta as queen.
The story of the genuine portion of the epic ends here.

•

In the last Book, which is suspected by many modern scholars to be spurious, it is
narrated that the people of Ayodhya speak ill of Rama for taking back Sita from
Ravana’s custody and Rama banishes her in deference to public opinion.

•

The Ramayana and the Mahabharata represent the ethos of our nation.

•

Tradition places the Ramayana earlier than the Mahabharata.

•

The Puranas are a very important branch, of the Hindu sacred literature. They enable
us to know the true import of the ethos, philosophy, and religion of the Vedas.

Dear Learners, in this session we learnt about the great epics of our country, in the next
session we will discuss on the literatures of south india

Famous Tamil Literature of South India.

Hello Everyone,
In the last session, we discussed on Introduction to Indian Philosophy and Famous
Sanskrit literatures of India. Today in this session, we will discuss on Famous Tamil
Literature of South India.
•

South India, with its rich history and stunning landscapes, has provided the setting for
some of the greatest epics in the ancient world.

•

In ancient times the association or academy of the most learned men of the Tamil land
was called ‘Sangam’ (or ‘Cankam’), whose chief function was promotion of
literature. Later Tamil writers mention the existence of three literary academies
(Sangams) at different periods. The last academy is credited with the corpus of
literature now known as ‘Sangam Works

Let’s see the ancient and famous literatures of South India, starting with Tolkappiyam
•

Tolkappiyam, the name signifying the ancient book or ‘the preserver of ancient
institutions’, was written by Tolkappiyanar and is the oldest extant Tamil grammar
dating back to 500 B.C.

•

It lays down rules for different kinds of poetical compositions drawn from the
examples furnished by the best works available at that time.

•

Iyal is elucidated clearly and systematically in Tolkappiyam.

•

Containing about 1,610 suttirams (aphorisms), it is in three parts-ezhuttu
(orthography), Sol (etymology), and porul (literary conventions and usages)-each with
nine sections.

•

While the first two parts are interesting from both linguistic and philological points of
view, the third, poruladhikdram, is most valuable as it gives a glimpse of the political,
social, and religious life of the people during the period when the author of this
treatise lived.

•

The principal works of the third Sangam have come down to us in the shape of
anthologies of poems. The two compilations forming the corpus of the poetry of the
third Sangam are Ettuttogai (eight anthologies) and Pattuppattu (ten idylls),

•

The anthologies of the third Sangam consist of poems divided into two broad
categories-aham or interior and puram or exterior. The former concerns all phases of
love between men and women. An allegory of the different stages through which the
soul of man passes from its manifestation in the body to its final unification with the
Supreme Being is seen in aham. The puram covers varieties of distinctive poems,
mostly relating to man’s social behaviour.

•

corresponding to five major regions of Tamil Nadu, these poems describe five types
of tracts with their distinctive features. These are: kurinci (mountainous region),
mullai (forest region), marutam (agricultural region), neytal (coastal region), and

pallai (desert region). True love, which is either karpu (wedded) or kalavu (furtive), is
considered under five aspects, namely, punartal (union), pirital (separation), irutal
(patience in separation), irangal (bewailing), and udal (sulking), and these are made to
correlate with tinai, the fivefold physiographical divisions.
•

The delineation of the early Tamil society in these poems is remarkably clear and a
great deal of light is thrown on the civilization of the Tamils.

•

Sangam works provide us with valuable information regarding religion, social life,
government, commerce, arts, music, dance, courtship, manners and customs, and the
daily life of the Tamils.

One another notable piece of work by Tiruvalluvar’s '(c. first century B.C.) is
Tirukkural or Kural,
•

Tirukkural which is in the form of couplets and deals with the three aims of life-aram
(righteousness), porul (wealth), and inbam or kamam (pleasure).

•

It consists of 133 chapters each containing ten couplets. Conveying noble thoughts
couched in concised language, each couplet is a gem by itself. The first part of Kural
(arattuppal) gives the essentials of Yoga philosophy. Besides, it deals with the happy
household life as well as guiding towards the path of renunciation. The thoughts of
Kural in its second part (porutpal) centre on polity and administration, including
citizenship and social relations, in an admirable way. The third part (inbattuppal or
kamattuppal), consisting of couplets in dramatic monologues, treats of the concept of
love.

Post-Sangam period: The Epics
•

The five major epics-Silappadikaram, Manimekalai, Jivaka-cintamani, Valaiyapati,
and Kundalakesi-are the outstanding contributions of the post-Sangam period.

•

In this session we will explore two of the ‘Five Great Jewels’ of Tamil literature: The
Lay of the Anklet (Cilappatikāram) and The Dancer with the Magic Bowl
(Maṇimēkalai). These epics were composed sometime between the 1st and 8th
centuries CE and present a view of the societies, religions, and cultures of ancient
South India. The central narratives of both epics follow the adventures of female
protagonists: Kaṇṇaki, a devoted wife turned goddess, and Maṇimēkalai, a dancercourtesan turned renunciant.

•

These two epics are also connected through their female characters, as Maṇimēkalai is
the daughter of Kaṇṇaki’s husband Kōvalaṉ and his mistress Mātavi. In conjunction
with reading these fascinating tales, we will also explore their literary and historical
contexts and their significance within the Jain and Buddhist religious traditions.

•

Silappadikaram - contains all the three aspects of Tamil literature, viz. iyal, isai, and
natakam, it has been designated as a muttamizhk-kappiyam. It is, therefore, invaluable
as a source-book of ancient Tamil dance and classical music-both vocal and
instrumental. The author of this work is the ascetic-poet Ilanko Adikal.

•

Manimekalai, a direct sequel to Silappadikaram, is also a great source of information
on ancient Tamil society. Written by Cittalai Cattanar, this epic marks a new

development in Tamil literature by presenting philosophical and religious debates in
mellifluous style.
With this, I hope you had a brief understanding of Sangam Literature, i.e, Tamil Literature
which is the ancient literatures of South India.
Thank you

Tamil Literature
Tamil literature goes back to the Sangam Era, named after the assembly (sangam) of poets.
Sangam Period
•

The period roughly between the 3rd century B.C. and 3rd century A.D. in South India
(the area lying to the south of river Krishna and Tungabhadra) is known as Sangam
Period.

•

It has been named after the Sangam academies held during that period that flourished
under the royal patronage of the Pandya kings of Madurai.

•

At the sangams, eminent scholars assembled and functioned as the board of censors
and the choicest literature was rendered in the nature of anthologies.

•

These literary works were the earliest specimens of Dravidian literature.

•

South India, during the Sangam Age, was ruled by three dynasties-the Cheras,
Cholas and Pandyas.

Three Sangams
According to the Tamil legends, there were three Sangams (Academy of Tamil poets) held in
the ancient South India popularly called Muchchangam.
•

The First Sangam, is believed to be held at Madurai, attended by gods and legendary
sages. No literary work of this Sangam is available.

•

The Second Sangam was held at Kapadapuram, only Tolkappiyam survives from this.

•

The Third Sangam was also held at Madurai. A few of these Tamil literary works
have survived and are a useful source to reconstruct the history of the Sangam period.

Sangam Literature
The Sangam literature includes Tolkappiyam, Ettutogai, Pattuppattu, Pathinenkilkanakku,
and two epics named – Silappathikaram and Manimegalai.
•

•

Tolkappiyam: It was authored by Tolkappiyar and is considered the earliest of Tamil
literary work.
•

Though it is a work on Tamil grammar, it also provides insights on the
political and socio-economic conditions of the time.

•

It is a unique work on grammar and poetics, in its three parts of nine sections
each, deals with Ezhuttu(letter), Col (word) and Porul (subject matter).

•

Almost all levels of the human language from the spoken to the most poetic lie
within the purview of Tolkappiyar’s analysis as he treats in exquisitely poetic
and epigrammatic statements on phonology, morphology, syntax, rhetoric,
prosody and poetics.

Ettutogai (Eight Anthologies): It consists of eight works – Aingurunooru, Narrinai,
Aganaooru, Purananooru, Kuruntogai, Kalittogai, Paripadal and Padirruppatu.

•

Pattuppattu (Ten Idylls): It consists of ten works – Thirumurugarruppadai,
Porunararruppadai, Sirupanarruppadai, Perumpanarruppadai, Mullaippattu,
Nedunalvadai, Maduraikkanji, Kurinjippatttu,Pattinappalai and Malaipadukadam.

•

Pathinenkilkanakku: It contains eighteen works about ethics and morals.
•

•

The most important among these works is Tirukkural authored
by Thiruvalluvar, the tamil great poet and philosopher.

Tamil Epics: The two epics Silappathikaram is written by Elango
Adigal and Manimegalai by Sittalai Sattanar.
•

They also provide valuable details about the Sangam society and polity.

Medieval Tamil literature
•

The medieval period, spanning from the 11th and 13th centuries, was one of harmony
amongst Tamil people. Avvaiyar, a female poet whose name translates to ‘respectable
woman’, created poems during this era that continue to be taught in Tamil schools
today. Avvaiyar is one of the most crucial poets of Tamil history, as her poems appeal
to children. Her well-known poem, Aathichoodi, demonstrates to children how to live
a life full of moral genuineness with the use of the Tamil alphabet.

Vijayanagar and Nayak period
•

The Vijayanagar and Nayak period, reigning from approximately 1300 to 1650 C.E.,
was a period in Tamil history where the Tamil country would be affected by an
invasion, and ultimately conquered. As a result, the rise of the Vijayanagar kingdom
and Nayak governance came about. Exemplary works in Tamil literature were still
produced in this era. For example, Thiruppugazh by Arunagirinathar.

Thiruppugazh
•

Thiruppugazh, created in the 15th century, is a work of religious songs praising Lord
Murugan. The background behind Arunagirinathar’s reason for
writing Thiruppugazh is quite intriguing. According to Arunagirinathar, Lord
Murugan saved him when he was going to end his life at a temple. Ultimately, this
reformed his life. Consequently, Arunagirinathar decides to make devotional songs to
thank Lord Murugan for saving him.

•

This period demonstrated the devotionality to religion prominently, especially with
the use of literature. As seen throughout this article, the Hindu religion is prominently
valued among Tamil people.

The modern era of Tamil literature
•

The late 18th to 19th centuries brought the Modern era in Tamil literature. This gave
us the works of Subramanya Bharathi, who was a writer and an important member in
terms of social reform. Bharathi was very influential, both with his literature and
activism.

•

Bharathi’s work is often cited as the inspiration for modern Tamil literature. His work
is said to involve both modernist and classical techniques. Additionally, his poems

show how outspoken he was about social issues, and often display rebellious remarks.
Bharathi covered a variety of topics in his works, from children’s songs to praising
those fighting for India’s independence.
Here is Bharathi’s commentary on the Indian caste system:
There is no caste system.
It is a sin to divide people on caste basis.
The ones who are really of a superior class are the ones
excelling in being just, wise, educated and loving.
The rise of Tamil novels
•

The modern era of Tamil literature was accompanied by a rise in novels.
Ramanichandaran would contribute to this rising trend with the composition of
modern romance novels in the 20th century. She is currently the best-selling author in
Tamil literature, with 178 novels written.

•

Ramanichandran’s focus on romance novels does not include the idea of caste
systems, which is a common controversy within South Asia because the caste system
is still used to this day.

•

One of her famous books, Kanney Kanmaniey, illustrates Madura and her lover,
Sathyan. Madura’s brother loses money while betting on horses, causing her and her
brother to work at Sathyan’s hotel. Sathyan unknowingly believes that Madura
betrayed him and ends up marrying another woman, but his wife ends up dying.
Conflicted with revenge and undying love, Sathyan is confused about how to act
towards Madura. In sum, the story follows Sathyan’s journey of love and figuring out
his feelings towards Madura.

•

As a result, these types of stories are very popular among Tamil women because it
allows them to live through these stories.

Cultural and linguistic significance in anthropology
•

Tamil, being one of the oldest recorded languages in linguistic history, has a diverse
library of literature. With commentaries on ethics and struggles, to songs depicting the
beauty of nature before the rise of demolition of the environment, Tamil literature
gives us a deep insight into the values of South Asian culture.

•

Some of these values are still appraised today. In retrospect, the Tamil people were
seemingly advanced in terms of thought and transcribing it into literature.

•

The exploration of this language allows for a better understanding of the Tamil
culture and its customs.

•

In addition, there is linguistic significance when looking at the history of Tamil
literature as well. Though most, if not all, literature from the 6th Century BCE does
not remain today, it is still evident that the Tamil people took time to record their
thoughts.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THIRUKURAL
INTRODUCTION:
• Tirukkural, (Tamil: “Sacred Couplets”) also spelled Tirukural or Thirukkural, also
called Kural, the most celebrated of the Patiren-kirkkanakku (“Eighteen Ethical
Works”) in Tamil literature and a work that has had an immense influence on Tamil
culture and life.
• It is usually attributed to the poet Tiruvalluvar, who lived in India in the sixth
century, though some scholars place it earlier (1st century BC)
• The Tirukkural (Tamil) also known as the Kural, is a traditional Tamil sangam
treatise on the art of living. There are 133 chapters in total, with 1330 couplets or
kurals.
• The Tirukkural has been compared to the great books of the world's major religions
for its practical concerns, poetic insights into daily life, and universal and timeless
approach.

ABOUT TIRUVALLUVAR:
Little is known about Tiruvalluvar, the work's author, except that he was born in
Mylaopore (Chennai, Tamilnadu) and belonged to the weaver community. He is also
known by many other names, including Nayanar, Theivappulavar, and Perunavalar. The
work is frequently referred to as Tamil Marai, a reference to its association with the
Vedas.

HISTORICAL INFORMATION:
 It is believed that Valluvar wrote the work in response to a request from his close
friend and student Elela Singan. When the work was finished, Valluvar took it to
Madurai, as was the custom of reading new compositions in public in front of
critics and scholars.
 The conceited scholars of Madurai insisted on measuring the greatness of the work
by placing it with other works on a plank kept afloat in the tank of the great temple
and seeing if the plank remained afloat. The significance of this is that the
greatness of a work is realised based on the divine qualities of the work rather than
the weight of its manuscript (written on Palm leaves).
 The Sangam Plank is said to have shrunk in size to hold only the Kural
manuscript, throwing out the rest, much to the surprise of the critics.

 Idaikkadar had praised Kural, saying that his greatness was such that Valluvar had
packed the essence of all knowledge from the vast world spanned by seven seas
inside a mustard seed. Anu had substituted the term kadugu (mustard) for
Auvaiyar (meaning an atom).
 It is interesting to note that the concept of Atom had already been established in
the Tamil country two thousand years ago.
THREE DIVISIONS IN THIRUKURALS:
• BOOK I – Aram (அறம் ):Book of Virtue(Dharma), dealing with moral
values of an individual and essentials of yoga philosophy(Chapters 1-38)
• BOOK II- Porul (ப ொருள் ):Book of Polity(Artha), dealing with socioeconomic values polity, society and administration(Chapters 39-108).
BOOK III- INBAM (இன் ம் ): Book of Love (Kama), dealing with
psychological values and love (Chapters 109-133).

STRUCTURE OF THIRUKURAL:
Tirukkural is a collection of 1330 couplets, each of which follows the structure
of "Kural Venba," a grammatical construction consisting of two lines of four
and three words. The piece is divided into 133 Adhikarams, each with ten
couplets.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIRUKURAL:
 Thirukkural equally emphasizes the vital principles of vegetarianism,
castelessness, and brotherhood. The Thirukkural's lessons are so powerful
that they can be regarded as a source of inspiration for people of all ages.
 The sage Valluvar, who was unanimously elevated to the rank of
Thiruvalluvar, observed both the goodness and the weaknesses of
governance at various levels and encouraged men and women to lead moral
lives based on strong values such as righteousness, justice, truth, love,
honesty, courage, and compassion through various couplets. He described
the lives and characteristics of ordinary citizens, wives, husbands, and kings,
among others.
 Thirukkural has become a research topic in many universities and learning
institutions around the world. It has been translated into over 40 languages,
and its universality has been universally acknowledged and praised.

OTHER INDIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE
Introduction
Richness of any culture can been seen and appreciated but when it comes to language and
literature it is to be read and heard. We have to appreciate and take pride in this particular
aspect of our culture. We must make it a point to read as many books written during those
times as it will help us to understand so many things that happened in those times. It will help
us to read more books and become familiar with so many things that our happening around us
today.
NORTHERN INDIAN LANGUAGES & LITERATURE
We have already seen how languages evolved in India right upto the early medieval period.
The old apabhramsha had taken new forms in some areas or was in the process of evolving
into other forms. These languages were evolving at two levels: the spoken and the written
language. The old Brahmi script of the Ashoka days had undergone a great change. The
alphabets during Ashoka’s period were uneven in size but by the time of Harsha, the letters
had become of the same size and were regular, presenting the picture of a cultivated hand The
studies have indicated that all the scripts of present northern Indian languages, except that of
Urdu, have had their origin in old Brahmi. A long and slow process had given them this
shape. If we compare the scripts of Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi, we can easily understand this
change. As for the spoken word, there are over 200 languages or dialects spoken in India at
present. Some are widely used while others are limited to a particular area. Out of all these,
only twenty-two have found their way into our Constitution. A large number of people speak
Hindi in its different forms that include Braj Bhasha, and Avadhi (spoken in Oudh region),
Bhojpuri, Magadhi, and Maithili (spoken around Mithila), and Rajasthani and Khadi Boli
(spoken around Delhi). Rajasthani is another variant or dialect of Hindi. This classification
has been made on the basis of literature produced by great poets over a length of time. Thus,
the language used by Surdas and Bihari has been given the name of Braj Bhasha; that used by
Tulsidas in the Ramacharitamanasa is called Avadhi and the one used by Vidyapati has been
termed as Maithili. But Hindi, as we know it today is the one called Khadi Boli. Though
Khusrau has used Khadi Boli in his compositions in the thirteenth century its extensive use in
literature began only in the nineteenth century. It even shows some influence of Urdu.

PERSIAN AND URDU
Urdu emerged as an independent language towards the end of the 4th century AD. Arabic and
Persian were introduced in India with the coming of the Turks and the Mongols. Persian
remained the court language for many centuries. Urdu as a language was born out of the
interaction between Hindi and Persian. After the conquest of Delhi (1192), the Turkish people
settled in this region. Urdu was born out of the interaction of these settlers and soldiers in the
barracks with the common people. Originally it was a dialect but slowly it acquired all the
features of a formal language when the authors started using Persian script. It was further
given an impetus by its use in Bahamani states of Ahmadnagar, Golkunda, Bijapur and Berar.
Here it was even called dakshini or daccani (southern). As time passed, it became popular
with the masses of Delhi.Urdu became more popular in the early eighteenth century. People
even wrote accounts of later Mughals in Urdu. Gradually it achieved a status where literatureboth poetry and prose-started being composed in it. The last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah
Zafar wrote poetry in it. Some of his couplets have become quite well known in the Hindi and
Urdu speaking areas. Urdu was given its pride of place by a large number of poets who have
left inimitable poetry for posterity. The earliest Urdu poet is supposed to be Khusrau (12531325). He started writing as a poet in the reign of Sultan Balban and was a follower of Nizam
ud-din Auliya. He is said to have composed ninty-nine works on separate themes and
numerous verses of poetry. Among the important works composed by him are Laila Majnun
and Ayina-I-Sikandari dedicated to Alau-din-Khalji. Among other well-known poets are
Ghalib, Zauq, and Iqbal. Iqbal’s Urdu poetry is available in his collection called Bang- i dara. His Sarejahan se achcha Hindostan hamara is sung and played at many of the national
celebrations in India. No army parade is considered complete without the army band playing
this tune. In big Indian cities like Delhi these are many programmes in which famous singers
are invited to sing nazams or Ghazals written by famous poets like Ghalib, Maum, Bulley
Shah, Waris Shah besides many others. So you can imagine how rich our language and
literary culture must have been to continue till today. It has enriched our lives and is central to
people meeting and intermingling with each other. Among the best prose writers were people
like Pandit Ratan Nath Sarshar, who wrote the famous Fasanah- i-Azad. Even in the early
days, Munshi Prem Chand, who is supposed to be a doyen of Hindi literature, wrote in Urdu.
Urdu has given us a new form of poem that is called a nazm. Urdu was patronised by the
Nawabs of Lucknow, who held symposiums in this language. Slowly it became quite popular.
Pakistan has adopted Urdu as the state language.

Development of Literature during the Mughal Period
There was a tremendous development in the field of literature during the Mughal times.
Babar and Humauan were lovers of literature. Baber was himself a great scholar of Persian.
He wrote a book known as Tuzek-e-Babari which is highly esteemed by the Turkish
Literature. Humayun got the treatise translated into Arabic. He too was a lover of learning
and had establihsed a big Library. Humayun Nama, tops the books written in his times. Akbar
was very fond of leaning. ‘Akbar Nama’, Sur Sagar, Ram Charitamanas are prominent among
the books written during his time. Malik Muhammad Jayasis Padmavat and Keshav’s Ram
Chandrika were also written during the same period. Jahangir greatly patronized literature.
Many scholars adorned his court. He too was a scholar of a high caliber and wrote his life
story. During Shah Jahan’s time there was a well known scholar named Abdul Hameed
Lahori. He wrote Badshah Nama. The literary activities suffered during Aurangzeb’s
time.Urdu literature started developing during the last days of the Mughal emperor. This
credit goes to Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan and Mirza Galib. The language of Sir Sayyid Ahmed
Khan was very simple and impressive. His compositions inspired the other urdu writer Mirza
Galib, who was a famous poet of his time. He made an important contribution to uplift Urdu
poetry. There were some other writers also who took interest in Urdu poetry and enriched the
Urdu literature. Maulvi Altab Hussain Ali, Akbar Allahabadi and Dr. Mohammed Iqbal are
some famous names. As Persian was the language of the court, much of the literature
produced in this period was written in Persian. Amir Khusrau and Amir Hasan Dehelvi wrote
superb poetry in Persian. Historians like Minhas-us-Siraj and Zia Barani and Ibn Batuta who
came to India during those days wrote accounts of rulers, important political events and
incidents in this language. In the medieval period, Persian was adopted as the court language.
Several historical accounts, administrative manuals and allied literature in this language have
come down to us. The mughal rulers were great patrons of leaning and literature. Babar wrote
his tuzuk (autobiography) in Turkish language, but his grandson Akbar got it translated into
Persian. Akbar patronized many scholars. He got Mahabharata translated into Persian.
Jahangir’s autobiography (Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri) is in Persian and is a unique piece of literature.
It is said that Noorjahan was an accomplished Persian poetess. Quite a fair amount of Persian
literature has been produced by the courtiers of the Mughals. Abul Fazl’s Akbarnamah and
Ain-e-Akbari is a fine piece of literature. From there we get a good deal of information about
Akbar and his times. Faizi wrote beautiful Persian poetry. Several collections of letters of the
Mughal period (insha) have come down to us. Besides shedding light on Mughal history, they

indicate different styles of letter writing. Another name in prose and history writing is that of
Chandra Bhan, a writer of Shahjahan’s days. Similarly, we have a work named Tabqat-iAlamgïri, shedding light on Aurangzeb. Badauni was another writer who belonged during
Akbar’s time. In the twentieth century, Iqbal wrote good Persian poetry. All this has now
become a part of Indian heritage and culture. Among the noted Hindu poets of this period
were Kabir, Tulsidas, Surdas and Rahim. Kabirs dohas are still so popular today while
Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas has become the most sacred book of the Hindus. Behari’s Satsai
written during Akbar’s reign is very famous. Alankarashekhara by Keshav Mishra was
produced in Akbar’s court. It was a great Sanskrit work on the styles of writing. Akbar also
got many Sanskrit books like Bhagwad Gita and Upanishads translated into Persian.
HINDI LITERATURE
These was a tremendous growth of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya,
Marathi and Gujarati during this time. In the South, Malayalam emerged as an independent
language in the 14th century The emergence of all these languages resulted in the decline of
Sanskrit as they came to be used as the medium through which the administrative machinery
functioned. The rise of the Bhakti movement and the use of these regional langages by the
various saints helped in their growth and development. We have already noted the various
dialects that developed in northern and western India. Prithviraj Raso is supposed to be the
first book in the Hindi language. It is an account of exploits of Prithviraj Chauhan. In its
imitation several other rasos were written. The language went on changing as the area where
it was used expanded. New words to express new situations were either coined or taken from
areas coming under its influence. Hindi literature looked to Sanskrit classics for guidance and
Bharata’s Natyashastra was kept in mind by Hindi writers. During the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries there started a movement in southern India that was called the Bhakti movement. As
its influence reached the north, it started affecting the prose and poetry that were being
composed in Hindi. Poetry now became largely devotional in nature.Some of the poets like
Tuisidas wrote poetry in a language which was of that region only, while others like Kabir,
who moved from place to place added Persian and Urdu words as well. Though it is said that
Tuisidas wrote Ramcharit Manas based on Valmiki’s Ramayana, he also alters situations and
adds quite a few new scenes and situations based on folklore. For example, Sita’s exile is
mentioned in Valmiki’s version but it is not mentioned in Tulsidas’s account. Tuisidas has
deified his hero while the hero of Valmiki is a human being.Hindi evolved during the
Apabhramsa stage between the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. and the 14th C. It was

characterized as Veergatha Kala i.e. the age of heroic poetry or the Adi Kala (early period). It
was patronised by the Rajput rulers as it glorified chiralry and poetry. The most famous
figures from this period were Kabir and Tulsidas.In modern times, the Khadi dialect became
more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in Sanskrit. Similarly, Surdas wrote
his Sur Sagar in which he talks of Krishna as an infant, a young lad indulging in pranks and a
young man engaged in dalliance with the gopis. These poets made a deep impression on the
minds of the listeners. If the festivals associated with Rama and Krishna have become so very
popular, the credit goes to these poets. Their versions became the source of inspiration not
only for other poets but also for painters in the medieval ages. They inspired Mirabai, who
sang in Rajasthani language, and Raskhan, who, though a Muslim, sang in praise of Krishna.
Nandadasa was an important Bhakti poet. Rahim and Bhushan were a class apart. Their
subject was not devotion, but spiritual. Bihari wrote his Satsai in the seventeenth century; it
gives us a glimpse of shringar(love) and other rasas. All the above-mentioned Hindi poets,
except Kabir, expressed their sentiments essentially to satisfy their own devotional instincts.
Kabir did not believe in institutionalised religion. He was a devotee of a formless God.
Chanting His name was the be-all and end-all for him. All these poets influenced the north
Indian society in a manner that had never happened earlier. As it is easier to remember poetry
than prose, they became immensely popular. During the last 150 years, many writers have
contributed to the development of modern India literature, written in a number of regional
languages as well as in English. One of the greatest Bengali writers, Rabindranath Tagore
became the first Indian to win the Nobel Prize for literature (Geetanjali) in 1913. However, it
is only with the beginning of nineteenth century that-Hindi prose came into its own.
Bharatendu Harishchandra was one of the earliest to produce dramas in Hindi which were
basically translations of texts written in Sanskrit and other languages. But he set the trend.
Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was another author who wrote translations or made adaptations
from Sanskrit. Bankim Chandra Chatterji (l 838-94) wrote novels originally in Bangla. They
came to be translated into Hindi and became very popular. Vande Mataram, our national
song, is an excerpt from his novel, Anand Math. Swami Dayanand’s contribution to Hindi
cannot be ignored. Originally a Gujarati and a scholar of Sanskrit, he advocated Hindi as a
common language for the whole of India. He started writing in Hindi and contributed articles
to journals essentially engaged in religious and social reforms. SatyarthaPrakash was his most
important work in Hindi. Among other names who have enriched Hindi literature, is that of
Munshi Prem Chand, who switched over from Urdu to Hindi. Surya Kant Tripathi, ‘Nirala’,
achieves recognition because he questioned the orthodoxies in society. Mahadevi Verma is

the first woman writer in Hindi to highlight issues related to women. Maithili Sharan Gupt is
another important name. Jaishankar Prasad wrote beautiful dramas.
Hindi Language Makes Progress in Modern Period
Hindi Language: The development of modern language started at the end of the 18th
century. The main writers of this period were Sadasukh Lal and Enshallah Khan. Bhartendu
Harishchandra also strengthened Hindi language. Similarly Raja Lakshman Singh translated
Shakuntala into Hindi. Hindi continued to develop in adverse circumstances as the office
work was done in Urdu
Hindi Language Makes Progress in Modern Period
Hindi Literature: Bhartendu Harish Chandra, Mahavira Prasad Dwivedi, Ramchandra
Shukla and Shyam Sunder Das were the main among the prose writers of Hindi literature. Jai
Shanker Prasad, Maithalisharan Gupta, Sumitranandan Pant, Suryakant Tripathi ‘Nirala’,
Mahadevi Verma, Ramdhari Singh ‘Dinkar’ and Haribans Rai ‘Bacchan’ made great
contribution to the development of Hindi poetry. Similarly, Prem Chand, Vrindavan lal Verma
and Ellachandra Joshi wrote novels and enriched Hindi literature.
If we look at the above writers, we find that they all wrote with a purpose. Swami Dayanand
wrote in order to reform the Hindu society and rid it of false beliefs and social evils. Munshi
Prem Chand tried to draw the attention of the society to the miserable existence of the poor
and Mahadevi Verma recipient of Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award
highlighted the conditions of women in the society. ‘Nirala’ became the pioneer of awakening
of Modern India.
BENGALI, ASSAMESE AND ORIYA LITERATURE
After Hindi, the next significant literature was the one that developed in Bengal. The Baptist
Mission Press was established in Serampore near Calcutta in 1800. East India Company
founded the Fort William College in the same year. It provided training to civil servants of
the Company in law, customs, religions, languages and literatures of India to enable them to
work more efficiently.The growth of the Bhakti movement and the compositon of various
hymns associated with Chaitanya provided a stimulus to the development and growth of
Bengali. Narrative poems called the Mangal Kavyas also grew popular during this period.
They propatated the worship of local deities like Chandi and transformed Puranic Gods like
Siva and Vishnu into household deities.In this regard, a very important landmark was
achieved by William Carey, who wrote a grammar of Bengali and published an English-

Bengali dictionary and also wrote books on dialogues and stories. It may be noted that the
grammar and dictionaries are important in the development of a literature. They guide the
writers as to the correctness of a sentence and also help them in finding suitable words for a
particular situation and idea.Although the aim of the press run by the missionaries was
mainly to propagate Christian faith but other presses run by local people helped in the
flourishing of non-Christian literature.Scores of pamphlets, small and big books and journals
were produced. In the meantime education spread, although at a very slow pace. But after
1835, when Macaulay won the battle against Orientalists, it spread at a faster pace. In 1854
came Sir Charles Wood’s Despatch and in 1857 the three universities of Calcutta, Madras and
Bombay were established. Besides textbooks for schools and colleges, other literature were
also produced. However it was Raja Ram Mohan Roy who wrote in Bengali besides English
that gave impetus to Bengali literature. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820-91) and Akshay
Kumar Dutta (1820- 86) were two other writers of this early period.In addition to these,
Bankim Chandra Chatterji (l834-94), Sharat Chandra Chatterji (l876-1938), and R.C. Dutta, a
noted historian and a prose writer, all contributed to the making of Bengali literature. But the
most important name that influenced the whole of India was that of Rabindra Nath Tagore
(1861-1941). Novels, dramas, short stories, criticism, music and essays, all flowed from his
pen. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1913 for his Geetanjali.However, a few things
need to be noted about the influence of Western ideas which permeated Bengal and later on
other parts of India. Upto 1800, most of the literature produced was limited to religion or
courtly literature. The Western influence brought the writers closer to the man in the street.
The subjects were mundane. Some religious literature was also produced but it hardly said
anything new.The final years of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth
century saw a new subject, nationalism, being taken up. Two things were seen in this new
trend. The first was the love for old history and culture and an awareness of the facts of
British exploitation. The second was a clarion call for arousing the Indians to drive out the
foreigners, both by persuasion and force. This new trend was expressed by Subrahmanyam
Bharti in Tamil and Qazi Nazrul Islam in Bengali.The contributions of these two writers in
arousing the nationalistic sentiments in the readers was tremendous. Their poetry was
translated into other Indian languages.Assamese - Like Bengali, Assamese also developed in
response to the Bhakti movement. Shankardeva who introduced Vaishnavism in Assam
helped in the growth of Assamese poetry. Even the Puranas were translated in Assamese.The
earliest Assamese literature consisted of buranjis (court chronicles). Shankardev has left
several devotional poems, which people song with rapturous pleasure, but it was only after

1827 that more interest was shown in producing Assamese literature. Two names, Lakshmi
Nath Bezbarua and Padmanaba Gohain Barua cannot be forgotten. From Orissa, a couple of
names are worth mentioning and these are Fakirmohan Senapati and Radha Nath Ray, whose
writings deserve considerable attention in the history of Oriya literature.The works of
Upendra Bhanja (1670 - 1720) were important as they ushered a new period of Oriya
literature. In Orissa the works of Saraladasa are regarded as the first works of Oriya literature.
PUNJABI AND RAJASTHANI LITERATURE
Punjabi is a language with several shades. It is being written in two scripts, Gurmukhi and
Persian. The Gurmukhi script till the end of the nineteenth century was almost limited to the
Adi Granth, the holy book of the Sikhs. Only a small number of people tried to learn the
script except the granthis, who recited the holy Granth in the gurdwaras. However, the
language did not lack literature. Guru Nanak was the first poet in Punjabi. Some other
contemporary poets, mostly Sufi saints, used to sing in this language. These Sufis or their
followers used the Persian script if they wanted to commit their poetry to writing. In this list,
the first name is that of Farid.
His poetry has found a place in the Adi Granth. The Adi Granth also contains poetry of the
next four gurus. All this literature belongs to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Amongst
the later gurus, the poetry of the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur has also contributed to the
Adi Granth. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth guru, was educated in Patna (Bihar), where he
learnt Persian and Sanskrit. He has composed two savaiyyas in Punjabi but these are not a
part of the Adi Granth.But it was the love stories of Heer and Ranjha, Sasi and Punnu and
Sohni and Mahiwal, which gave this language its theme in the early days. Even the story of
Puran Bhagat found favour with some poets. Beautiful poems written by some known and
some unknown poets have come down to us. These are being sung by local singers for the
last two or three hundred years. There are several other poetic stories which have been
composed by the locals. This folklore has been preserved. The most important of these is
Heer of Waris Shah. It is the most popular of the early works. It is a landmark in Punjabi
poetry. Similar is the popularity of Bulley Shah who was a Sufi saint. He has left a large
number of songs. One of his popular forms of compositions was called kafi; it was sung in a
classical musical form. Kafis are sung by people with great fervour.In the twentieth century,
Punjabi had come into its own. Bhai Vir Singh composed an epic, named Rana Surat Singh.
Puran Singh and Dr. Mohan Singh are among the best known writers. Essays, short stories,
poetry, novels, criticism and all other forms of writing have adorned the Punjabi literary

scene.Rajasthani, a dialect of Hindi, had its own part to play. The bards (itinerant singers)
moved from place to place, providing entertainment and keeping the stories of heroes alive. It
was from these ballads that Colonel Todd collected the heroic stories of Rajasthan and put
them in the Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan. But the devotional songs of Mira Bai have a
place of pride in the history of language as well as devotional music. Mira Bai’s love for her
lord (Lord Krishna) is sometimes so intense that it transcends this mundane world and
transports one to the land of this singer.The development of the Bhakti movement led to the
rise of the different regional languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Kannada, Tamil
and Telugu.
GUJARATI LITERATURE
Early Gujarati literature is available in the form of Bhakti songs of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. It still follows the old tradition which is popular in Gujarat. Narsi Mehta’s
name is the foremost in this respect. The people of Gujarat wove these devotional songs in
their folk dances and their religious forms often find expressions in their celebrations.
Narmad’s poetry gave a fillip to the Gujarati literature. Saraswati Chandra, a novel by
Govardhan Ram, has become a classic and has given great impetus to other writers. But
probably a name that cannot be forgotten is that of Dr. K.M. Munshi. He was a novelist, an
essayist and a historian, and has left a plethora of historical novels. In these books he exhibits
his ability to mix fact with fiction. Prithvi Vallabha is one of his finest novels. A special
mention must be made of Narsi Mehta whose songs in praise of Krishna not only made him a
very popular figure but also made Gujarati language popular.
SINDHI LITERATURE
Sindh was one of the important centres of Sufis, who established khanqahs at various places.
The Sufi singers with their devotional music made the language popular. The credit for
creating literature in Sindhi goes to Mirza Kalish Beg and Dewan Kauramal.
MARATHI LITERATURE
Maharashtra is situated on a plateau where a large number of local dialects were in use.
Marathi grew out of these these local dialects. The Portuguese missionaries started using
Marathi for preaching their gospel.The earliest Marathi poetry and prose is by Saint
Jnaneshwar (Gyaneshwar) who lived in the thirteenth century. He wrote a long commentary
on the Bhagavad Gita. He was the one who started the kirtan tradition in Maharashtra. He
was followed by Namdev (l 270- 1350), Gora, Sena and Janabai. All these sang and

popularised the Marathi language. Their songs are sung even today by the Verkari pilgrirns on
their way to Pandharpur pilgrimage. Almost two centuries later, Eknath (l 533-99) came on
the scene. He wrote the commentaries on the Ramayana and the Bhagawat Purana. His songs
are very popular all over Maharashtra.Then came Tukarama (1598-1650). He is supposed to
be the greatest Bhakti poet of them all. Ramdas (1608-81), who was the guru of Shivaji, is the
last of these hymn writers. He was the devotee of Rama. He inspired Shivaji. The closing
years of the nineteenth century saw an upsurge in the Marathi literature. It was a nationalist
movement that made Marathi prose popular and prominent. Bal Gangadhar Tilak (l 8571920) started his Journal Kesari in Marathi. This helped the growth of Marathi literature. But
the role of Keshav Sut and V.S. Chiplunkar was no less. Hari Narayan Apte and Agarkar
wrote novels which became very popular. All these prose writers made great contribution to
the development of Marathi literature. The name of H.G Salgaokar is remembered for writing
inspirational poetry. Besides, the names of M.G. Ranade, K.T. Telang, G.T. Madholkar (poet
and novelist) are no less important.
KASHMIRI LITERATURE
Kashmir shot into literary prominence, when Kalhana wrote Rajatarangini in Sanskrit But
this was in the language of the elite. For locals, Kashmiri was the popular dialect. Here also
the Bhakti movement played its role. One Lal Ded, who lived in the fourteenth century, was
probably the first to sing in the Kashmiri language. She was a Shaivite mystic. After Islam
spread in this area, the Sufi influence also came to be visible. Haba Khatoon, Mahjoor, Zinda
Kaul, Noor Din also known as Nund Rishi, Akhtar Mohiuddin, Sufi Ghulam Mohammad and
Dina Nath Nadim wrote devotional poetry in Kashmiri. These people contributed to the
growth of Kashmiri literature.The Western influence did not reach Kashmir till the end of the
nineteenth century. In 1846, after the first Sikh War, the Dogras of Jammu became the rulers
there. The Dogras were more interested in Dogri language than in Kashmiri. There were
hardly any schools or education. There was widespread poverty and economic backwardness.
All these led to a lack of good literature in Kashmir.Though the list of Modern Indian
languages can have many languages, the constitution of India has originally about 15
languages as national languages i.e. Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Marathi,
Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam. Three more
langauges i.e. Nepali, Manipuri and Konkani have been added now to the list.

Indian Languages and its Significance in International Context
Indian Literature: Vedas from India
Four Vedas-Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva are from most ancient text available from
India, which have reached throughout the world through mostly English, but through
other languages like German translations as well
Ancient Texts-Philosophical and Creative
Vedas, particularly Rig-Veda is known for its creative and aesthetic poetry as well.
Upanishads and texts of Shaddarshanas-Six Schools of Indian philosophy, including
non believer Samkhya philosophy, Buddhist, Jainism, Atheist Lokayata are more of
theoretical texts. These are all known to the world through translations. Apart from
these philosophical texts, there is a rich heritage of Sanskrit creative literature as well.
Creative Sanskrit Literature
Sanskrit has been language of philosophical and creative literature-both. Apart from
Mahabharta, Ramayana and texts like Panchtantra and Hitopadesh, Sanskrit literature
is known world over for its poetry and drama with Kalidas as most known name.
Shakespeare and Kalidas!aa
It is common refrain among literary critics in India to refer Kalidas as ‘Shakespeare of
India’, though Kalidas lived nearly one thousand years before Shakespeare, that is
why some critics will put it in reverse order as well-’Shakespeare as Kalidas of
England’! Whatever way, but it reflects the concept of ‘World Literature’ and also
Comparative study of literature, which would never have been possible without
translations of the texts.
Shakuntala Translation
Translation of Abhigyan Shakuntalam in English was first done by William Jones in
1789 and after that by Sir Monier Williams in prose form in 1853, later more than 46
translations in twelve European languages appeared and now complete dramas and
poetry collections of Kalidas are available in many English translations. English and
other languages translations of many other Sanskrit classic writers are also available
like that of Bhavbhuti , Kiratarjun etc.
Contribution of Indian Creative Writing to World Literature
Apart from classical Sanskrit literature, medieval period Indian literature is also
known to the world, particularly Indian Bhakti movement poets like Kabir, Guru
Nanak, Akka Mahadevi and many more through their translations. In modern period,
big number of translations were done from Indian languages literatures. India has 22
national languages in 8th schedule of Indian constitution and 24 recognised by
Sahitya Akademi-Academy of Letters for purpose of awarding annual best book
prizes.

Translations of Mirza Ghalib(Mirza Beg Asadullah Khan also known as Mirza Ghalib
was an Urdu and Persian poet of the 19th century Mughal and British era in the Indian
Subcontinent)

Many scholars, even from non literary background have been fascinated by Ghalib’s
philosophical Urdu ghazals. Aijaz Ahmad and many other scholars and translators
have rendered Ghalib’s poetry and prose in English. Mirza Ghalib lived during 1857’s
first war of Independence of India and went through lot of hard times as well, but his
poetry is claimed to be as national heritage by both India and Pakistan, though there
was no Pakistan during Ghalib’s times

Role of Translation in First Noble Prize of Literature to India
Rabindranath Tagore, most eminent Indian writer of Bengali language got Noble prize
for literature in 1913, till now only Indian to receive this award for literature.
Interesting part of this narrative is that Tagore himself translated 103 of his Bengali
poems in English and took them to England.

Geetanjali...
Tagore recited his translations in many gatherings and W.B Yeats, the great English
poet was so impressed that he wrote forward to these poems and the small collection
was published in English.
Tagore received the award for his Bengali poetry, but facilitated by his own English
translation of the poems.
Tagore’s example of his own translation and Noble prize on it, underlines the
significance of Translation as tool of literary communication in the world. Now
almost all the Bengali writings of Tagore are available in English and many Indian
languages translation, some in other world languages translations as well.
Premchand and his novel ‘Godan’
Premchand, a Hindi and Urdu writer published his classic novel-Godan in Hindi and
Urdu both, few months before his death. The novel based on the real life of Indian
peasantry became Indian classic and has been twice translated into English.
Godan (Novel wriiten by Premchand)
Jai Rattan and P. Lal did first English translation of Godan in 1957, which became
quite popular. Later Gordon C Roadarmel did English translation of Godan in 1968,
which is considered better than earlier one.
The novel was selected by UNESCO to be translated into many world languages and
so it has been.Apart from Godan, many other fiction writings of Premchand are now
available in English and other languages. Ghalib,Tagore and Premchand represents
India as the best faces of Indian literature on world literary scene.
Importance of Translation in Indian literary Scenario
As mentioned earlier, India itself is storehouse of huge literature written in various
Indian languages, which reaches other Indian languages through translation among
Indian languages. There are two major source languages of inter Indian literary
translation-Hindi and English. Text of any Indian language is first translated into
either Hindi or English and then through that medium it is translated into many more
Indian languages.

Inter Indian Translations
Generally literature of North, West and East Indian languages like-Punjabi, Urdu,
Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Assamese etc. is first translated into Hindi and then from
that medium to many other Indian languages.
Translations from South Indian languages are generally done first in English and then
from that medium, these are translated into other Indian languages. Southern
languages are part of Dravidian group and other three regions languages are from
Indo-Aryan group of languages
Inter Indian Languages Translations
These translations are done sometimes without the help of a medium language like
Hindi or English too, like Tamil to Bengali or Marathi to Assamese etc.
Sahitya Akademi by instituting National Translation Prize among inter Indian
languages translations has encouraged this process as well. This author has also
received National Translation Prize from Sahitya Akademi-Indian Academy of
Letters for Inter-Indian language translation.

Revolutionary poet Pash and his poetry
Pash created a niche for himself as trendsetter poet in the seventies as a radical poet.
As he was against both Khalistani terrorism and state terrorism, he was assassinated
by Khalistani terrorists on 23rd March, his Punjabi poetry in Hindi, which was
published in different volumes, one of which mentioned above-Samay O’Bhai
Samay’(Time O’ Brother Time) ,published in 1993, was awarded National
Translation Prize by Sahitya Akademi in 2002.

Hindi translation of Pash clicked so much that poet became more popular in Hindi
than his own mother tongue Punjabi. Many more translations were done from Hindi
translation of the poet in Marathi, Guajarati, Urdu, Bengali, Malayalam, Telugu etc.
Indian languages and thus designating him as major Indian poet rather than being just
a Punjabi poet. His poetry was compared to Pablo Neruda (got noble prize in
Literature, 1971) by some critics, so bringing him to the scenario of world literature as
English translation of his poetry were also done.

4. Religion and Philosophy in Ancient India

Hello learners,
In this session, let us discuss on the Religion and Philosophy in Ancient India
•

In classical India, philosophy was understood as contributing to human well-being by
freeing people from misconceptions about themselves and the world. Ultimate wellbeing was conceived as some sort of fulfilment outside the conditions of space and
time. Philosophies, as well as religious traditions, understood themselves as paths to
that final goal

Let’s start with Vedic philosophy
•

Religion of the Rig Vedic people was very simple in the sense that it consisted mainly
of worship of numerous deities representing the various phenomena of nature through
prayers.

•

It was during the later Vedic period that definite ideas and about the true nature of
soul or Atman and the cosmic principal philosophies or Brahman who represented the
ultimate reality were developed.

•

These Vedic philosophical concepts later on gave rise to six different schools of
philosophies called shada darshana. They fall in the category of the orthodox system
as the final authority of the Vedas is recognised by all of them. Let us now find out
more about these six schools of Indian philosophy.

•

Samkhya System:

•

Yoga

•

Nyaya

•

Vaisheshika

•

Mimamsa

•

Vedanta:

•

Charvaka school

Let’s learn on each school briefly
Samkhya System:
•

The Samkhya philosophy holds that reality is constituted of two principles one female
and the other male i.e. Prakriti, Purusha respectively.

•

Prakriti and Purusha are completely independent and absolute. According to this
system, Purusha is mere consciousness; hence it cannot be modified or changed.
Prakriti on the other hand is constituted of three attributes, thought, movement and the
change or transformation of these attributes brings about the change in all objects.

•

The Samkhya philosophy tries to establish some relationship between Purusha and
Prakriti for explaining the creation of the universe. The propounder of this philosophy
was Kapila, who wrote the Samkhya sutra.

•

In fact Samkhya school explained the phenomena of the doctrine of evolution and
answered all the questions aroused by the thinkers of those days.

Yoga:
•

Yoga literally means the union of the two principal entities. The origin of yoga is
found in the Yogasutra of Patanjali believed to have been written in the second
century BC. By purifying and controlling changes in the mental mechanism, yoga
systematically brings about the release of purusha from prakriti.

•

Yogic techniques control the body, mind and sense organs. Thus, this philosophy is
also considered a means of achieving freedom or mukti.

•

This freedom could be attained by practising self-control (yama), observation of rules
(niyama), fixed postures (asana), breath control (pranayama), choosing an object
(pratyahara) and fixing the mind (dharna), concentrating on the chosen object
(dhyana) and complete dissolution of self, merging the mind and the object
(Samadhi). Yoga admits the existence of God as a teacher and guide.

Nyaya
•

Nyaya is considered as a technique of logical thinking. According to Nyaya, valid
knowledge is defined as the real knowledge, that is, one knows about the object as it
exists.

•

For example, it is when one knows a snake as a snake or a cup as a cup. Nyaya system
of philosophy considers God who creates, sustains and destroys the universe.
Gautama is said to be the author of the Nyaya Sutras.

Vaisheshika
•

Vaisheshika system is considered as the realistic and objective philosophy of
universe. The reality according to this philosophy has many bases or categories which
are substance, attribute, action, genus, distinct quality and inherence.

•

Vaisheshika thinkers believe that all objects of the universe are composed of five
elements–earth, water, air, fire and ether. They believe that God is the guiding
principle.

•

The living beings were rewarded or punished according to the law of karma, based on
actions of merit and demerit. Creation and destruction of universe was a cyclic
process and took place in agreement with the wishes of God.

Mimamsa
•

Mimamsa philosophy is basically the analysis of interpretation, application and the
use of the text of the Samhita and Brahmana portions of the Veda.

•

According to Mimamsa philosophy Vedas are eternal and possess all knowledge, and
religion means the fulfilment of duties prescribed by the Vedas. This philosophy
encompasses the Nyaya-Vaisheshika systems and emphasizes the concept of valid
knowledge.

•

Its main text is known as the Sutras of Gaimini which have been written during the
third century BC. The essence of the system according to Jaimini is Dharma which is
the dispenser of fruits of one’s actions, the law of righteousness itself. This system
lays stress on the ritualistic part of Vedas.

Vedanta
•

Vedanta implies the philosophy of the Upanishad, the concluding portion of the
Vedas.

•

Shankaracharya wrote the commentaries on the Upanishads, Brahmasutras and the
Bhagavad Gita. Shankaracharya’s discourse or his philosophical views came to be
known as Advaita Vedanta.

•

Advaita literally means non-dualism or belief in one reality. Shankaracharya
expounded that ultimate reality is one, it being the Brahman. According to Vedanta
philosophy, ‘Brahman is true, the world is false and self and Brahman are not
different, Shankaracharya believes that the Brahman is existent, unchanging, the
highest truth and the ultimate knowledge.

•

He also believes that there is no distinction between Brahman and the self. The
knowledge of Brahman is the essence of all things and the ultimate existence.
Ramanuja was another well known Advaita scholar. Among different schools of
philosophy was found one philosophy which reached the climax of philosophic
thought that the human mind can possibly reach, and that is known as the Vedantic
philosophy.

Charvaka school
•

Brihaspati is supposed to be the founder of the Charvaka School of philosophy. It
finds mention in the Vedas and Brihadaranyka Upanishad.

•

Thus, it is supposed to be the earliest in the growth of the philosophical knowledge. It
holds that knowledge is the product of the combination of four elements which leaves
no trace after death. Charvaka philosophy deals with the materialistic philosophy.

•

It is also known as the Lokayata Philosophy – the philosophy of the masses.
According to Charvaka there is no other world. Hence, death is the end of humans and
pleasure the ultimate object in life. Charvaka recognises no existence other than this
material world.

•

Since God, soul, and heaven, cannot be perceived, they are not recognised by
Charvakas. Out of the five elements earth, water, fire, air and ether, the Charvakas do
not recognise ether as it is not known through perception. The whole universe
according to them is thus consisted of four elements.

Jain philosophy

•

Like the Charvakas, the Jains too do not believe in the Vedas, but they admit the
existence of a soul. They also agree with the orthodox tradition that suffering (pain)
can be stopped by controlling the mind and by seeking right knowledge and
perception and by observing the right conduct. The Jaina philosophy was first
propounded by the tirthankar Rishabha Deva

•

There were twenty-four tirthankaras who actually established the Jaina darshan. The
first tirthankar realised that the source of Jaina philosophy was Adinath.

•

The twenty fourth and the last tirthankar was named Vardhaman Mahavira who gave
great impetus to Jainism. Mahavira was born in 599 BC. He left worldly life at the age
of thirty and led a very hard life to gain true knowledge.

•

After he attained Truth, he was called Mahavira. He strongly believed in the
importance of celibacy or brahamcharya.

Jain Theory of Reality:
•

Seven Kinds of Fundamental Elements: The Jainas believe that the natural and
supernatural things of the universe can be traced back to seven fundamental elements.

•

They are jiva, ajivaa, astikaya, bandha, samvara, nirjana, and moksa. Substances like
body which exist and envelope (like a cover) are astïkaya. Anastikayas like ‘time’
have no body at all. The substance is the basis of attributes (qualities). The attributes
that we find in a substance are known as dharmas.

•

The Jainas believe that things or substance have attributes. These attributes also
change with the change of kala (time). From their point of view, the attributes of a
substance are essential, and eternal or unchangeable. Without essential attributes, a
thing cannot exist. So they are always present in everything. For example,
consciousness (chetana) is the essence of the soul; desire, happiness and sorrow are its
changeable attributes.

Philosophy of the Buddha
•

Gautama Buddha, who founded the Buddhist philosophy, was born in 563 BC at
Lumbini, a village near Kapilavastu in the foothills of Nepal. His childhood name was
Siddhartha. His mother, Mayadevi, died when he was hardly a few days old. He was
married to Yashodhara, a beautiful princess, at the age of sixteen. After a year of the
marriage, he had a son, whom they named Rahul. But at the age of twenty-nine,
Gautama Buddha renounced family life to find a solution to the world’s continuous
sorrow of death, sickness, poverty, etc.

•

He went to the forests and meditated there for six years. Thereafter, he went to Bodh
Gaya (in Bihar) and meditated under a pipal tree.

•

It was at this place that he attained enlightenment and came to be known as the
Buddha. Buddha presented simple principles of life and practical ethics that people
could follow easily.

•

He considered the world as full of misery. Man’s duty is to seek liberation from this
painful world.

•

He strongly criticised blind faith in the traditional scriptures like the Vedas. Buddha’s
teachings are very practical and suggest how to attain peace of mind and ultimate
liberation from this material world.

•

Vedanta Philosophy and Upanished
Hello learners, in this session, let us discuss on the six primary concepts of Upanished
I.

Brahman

Beyond Maya, there is an unchanging reality called Brahman (lit. “to expand”)
The Upanishads emphasize the impermanence of the empirical world, physical reality as we
experience it through our sense. MAYA
Four Claims About Brahman
Brahman is the fundamental principle of the universe. ( Kena Upanishad IV and V)
Brahman is the reality in all, and all things are in Brahman. (Svetasvatara Upanishad, IV.2-4)
Brahman is the state of non-duality. (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, IV.v.14-15)
Brahman is Ineffable. (Kena Upanishad, 1.5-9)
BRAHMAN AS THE IMPERSONAL ABSOLUTE
These central claims of the Upanishads about Brahman suggest that Brahman is not a personal
being, not a being with attributes that characterize “persons” (e.g., self-awareness, perspectival
experience, deliberative rationality, and being the subject of intentional states).
On this view, Brahman is formless or attributeless (nirguna) and not a personal God.
If Brahman is without from, then “gods” represent different provisional manifestations of
brahman in maya. The trimurti (three forms) represent Brahman manifested in the processes of
creation, preservation, and dissolution and recreation of the cosmos.
BRAHMAN AS CREATOR?
The Upanishads speak of Brahman as creator. However even where brahman is conceived of in
personal terms, “Creation” refers to a necessary emanation of the universe from the being of
Brahman, like the flowing of a web from a spider.
The Upanishads affirm eternal, cyclical processes of the origination of order, its evolution,
eventual dissolution.
“Bliss (Ananda) is Brahman, for from bliss all beings are born; by bliss, when born, they live; and
into bliss they enter at their death” (Taittiriyaka Upanishad, III.6)
II. ATMAN
The True Self (Atman)
The Upanishads teach the existence of a true Self called Atmen.
Atman is distinguished from the individual personality or ego formed through attachments to
sense objects.
The true self of each person is not identical with the body or person’s mind as conditioned by
sense experience.

“That Self (Atman) is not this, it is not that (neti,neti). It is unseizable, for it cannot be seized;
indestructible, for it cannot be destroyed; unattached, for it does not attach itself; is unbound,
does not tremble, is not injured” Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, iv.v.15
III AVIDYA
The human perspective is characterized by ignorance (avidya) of the true nature of reality and
the self.
Human persona identify themselves with their body or with their individual states of
consciousness formed through contact with and attachment to sense objects. This is the false
ego or false self.
IV SAMSARA AND KARMA
The Upanishads teach that all life forms move through repeated cycles of birth, death, and
rebirth, until final liberation from this cycle.
The cycle o the death and rebirth is called Samsara
Its fuel or energy is called Karma
The termination of the cycle is called Moksha
Rebirth is fueled and directed by Karma (Sanskrit root kri, meaning “action”)
Broadly stated, karma is a law od cause and effect according to which actions in one lifetime
influence action in a subsequent life.
Attachment to material forms of existence (modes of false ego) is the basic karmic energy that
fuels samsara. The form of one’s karma is shaped by the specific nature of one’s attachments.
Rebirth is not restricted to rebirth as a human being, but it extends to the animal world and
other realms of existence. The form of one’s karma (good or bad) determines the realm of
existence into which one is reborn.
Rebirth is not desirable. It implies that a person is still trapped in ignorance about the nature of
reality through various attachments to sense objects.
VI MOKSHA
Moksha is the state of release from samsara.
Attachments=>False Ego=>Karma=>Samsara
What is required is a dismantling or dissolution of the false ego. Therefore, we must let go of our
attachments to sense objects or materials forms of existence.
DESTRUCTION OF THE FALSE EGO
Spiritual discipline dismantles the false ego:
Spiritual Practice Consists in Observing Moral Laws (aimed at renunciation of material
attachments) and Meditation.

Meditation
Having heard and reflected on the word of Brahman in the scriptures, one must practice
concentration on the truth of Brahman and the self, repeating mantras such as OM ( which
signifies the cosmic power of Brahman) or Aham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman)
THE UTIMATE STATE (MOKSHA)
Spiritual practice leads to moksha (Liberation)
Moksha is freedom from samsara and thus freedom from suffering.
Moksha is absolute consciousness; “Brahman realization” and “Self-realization” since the true
nature of reality (Brahman) and the true self (Atman) is perceived.
Realization of Brahman and the self
Sat-chit-ananda
Being (sat)
Consciousness (chit)
Bliss (Ananda)
Satchitananda is also the name of Brahman.
So, moksha is union with Brahman.

Vedanta Philosophy and Upanished
Hello learners, in this session, let us discuss on the six primary concepts of Upanished
I.

Brahman

Beyond Maya, there is an unchanging reality called Brahman (lit. “to expand”)
The Upanishads emphasize the impermanence of the empirical world, physical reality as we
experience it through our sense. MAYA
Four Claims About Brahman
Brahman is the fundamental principle of the universe. ( Kena Upanishad IV and V)
Brahman is the reality in all, and all things are in Brahman. (Svetasvatara Upanishad, IV.2-4)
Brahman is the state of non-duality. (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, IV.v.14-15)
Brahman is Ineffable. (Kena Upanishad, 1.5-9)
BRAHMAN AS THE IMPERSONAL ABSOLUTE
These central claims of the Upanishads about Brahman suggest that Brahman is not a personal
being, not a being with attributes that characterize “persons” (e.g., self-awareness, perspectival
experience, deliberative rationality, and being the subject of intentional states).
On this view, Brahman is formless or attributeless (nirguna) and not a personal God.
If Brahman is without from, then “gods” represent different provisional manifestations of
brahman in maya. The trimurti (three forms) represent Brahman manifested in the processes of
creation, preservation, and dissolution and recreation of the cosmos.
BRAHMAN AS CREATOR?
The Upanishads speak of Brahman as creator. However even where brahman is conceived of in
personal terms, “Creation” refers to a necessary emanation of the universe from the being of
Brahman, like the flowing of a web from a spider.
The Upanishads affirm eternal, cyclical processes of the origination of order, its evolution,
eventual dissolution.
“Bliss (Ananda) is Brahman, for from bliss all beings are born; by bliss, when born, they live; and
into bliss they enter at their death” (Taittiriyaka Upanishad, III.6)
II. ATMAN
The True Self (Atman)
The Upanishads teach the existence of a true Self called Atmen.
Atman is distinguished from the individual personality or ego formed through attachments to
sense objects.
The true self of each person is not identical with the body or person’s mind as conditioned by
sense experience.

“That Self (Atman) is not this, it is not that (neti,neti). It is unseizable, for it cannot be seized;
indestructible, for it cannot be destroyed; unattached, for it does not attach itself; is unbound,
does not tremble, is not injured” Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, iv.v.15
III AVIDYA
The human perspective is characterized by ignorance (avidya) of the true nature of reality and
the self.
Human persona identify themselves with their body or with their individual states of
consciousness formed through contact with and attachment to sense objects. This is the false
ego or false self.
IV SAMSARA AND KARMA
The Upanishads teach that all life forms move through repeated cycles of birth, death, and
rebirth, until final liberation from this cycle.
The cycle o the death and rebirth is called Samsara
Its fuel or energy is called Karma
The termination of the cycle is called Moksha
Rebirth is fueled and directed by Karma (Sanskrit root kri, meaning “action”)
Broadly stated, karma is a law od cause and effect according to which actions in one lifetime
influence action in a subsequent life.
Attachment to material forms of existence (modes of false ego) is the basic karmic energy that
fuels samsara. The form of one’s karma is shaped by the specific nature of one’s attachments.
Rebirth is not restricted to rebirth as a human being, but it extends to the animal world and
other realms of existence. The form of one’s karma (good or bad) determines the realm of
existence into which one is reborn.
Rebirth is not desirable. It implies that a person is still trapped in ignorance about the nature of
reality through various attachments to sense objects.
VI MOKSHA
Moksha is the state of release from samsara.
Attachments=>False Ego=>Karma=>Samsara
What is required is a dismantling or dissolution of the false ego. Therefore, we must let go of our
attachments to sense objects or materials forms of existence.
DESTRUCTION OF THE FALSE EGO
Spiritual discipline dismantles the false ego:
Spiritual Practice Consists in Observing Moral Laws (aimed at renunciation of material
attachments) and Meditation.

4.1 Religion and Philosophy in Mediaval Period

Hello learners,
In this session, let us discuss on the Religion and Philosophy in Mediaval Period
•

Do you know the medieval period in India saw the rise and growth of the Sufi
movement and the Bhakti movement. The two movements brought a new form of
religious expression amongst Muslims and Hindus. The Sufis were mystics who
called for liberalism in Islam.

•

They emphasised on an egalitarian society based on universal love. The Bhakti saints
transformed Hinduism by introducing devotion or bhakti as the means to attain God.
For them caste had no meaning and all human beings were equal.

•

The Sufi and Bhakti saints played an important role in bringing the Muslims and
Hindus together. By using the local language of the people, they made religion
accessible and meaningful to the common people

The Sufi movement
•

Islam was founded by Prophet Muhammad. Islam saw the rise of many religious and
spiritual movements within it. These movements were centered mainly around the
interpretation of the Quran. There were two major sects that arose within Islam – the
Sunnis and Shias. Our country has both the sects, but in many other countries like
Iran, Iraq, Pakistan etc. you will find followers of only one of them. Among the
Sunnis, there are four principal schools of Islamic Law, these are based upon the
Quran and Hadis.

•

The greatest challenge to orthodox Sunnism came from the rationalist philosophy or
Mutazilas, who professed strict monotheism. According to them, God is just and has
nothing to do with man’s evil actions. Men are endowed with free will and are
responsible for their own actions.

•

Sufism in India: The advent of Sufism in India is said to be in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.

•

In the beginning, the main centers of the Sufis were Multan and Punjab. By the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Sufis had spread to Kashmir, Bihar, Bengal
and the Deccan.

•

It may be mentioned that Sufism had already taken on a definite form before coming
to India. Its fundamental and moral principles, teachings and orders, system of fasting,
prayers and practice of living in khanqahs had already been fixed.

•

The Sufis came to India via Afghanistan on their own free will. Their emphasis upon
a pure life, devotional love and service to humanity made them popular and earned
them a place of honour in Indian society.

The importance of the Sufi movement

•

The Sufi movement made a valuable contribution to Indian society. Like the Bhakti
saints who were engaged in breaking down the barriers within Hinduism, the Sufis too
infused a new liberal outlook within Islam. The interaction between early Bhakti and
Sufi ideas laid the foundation for more liberal movements of the fifteenth century.
You will read that Sant Kabir and Guru Nanak had preached a non-sectarian religion
based on universal love. A notable contribution of the Sufis was their service to the
poorer and downtrodden sections of society.

•

While the Sultan and ulema often remained aloof from the day-to-day problems of
the people, the Sufi saints maintained close contact with the common people. The Sufi
movement encouraged equality and brotherhood.

The Bhakti movement
•

The development of Bhakti movement took place in Tamil Nadu between the seventh
and

•

twelfth centuries. It was reflected in the emotional poems of the Nayanars (devotees
of Shiva) and Alvars (devotees of Vishnu). These saints looked upon religion not as a
cold formal worship but as a loving bond based upon love between the worshipped
and worshipper.

•

They wrote in local languages, Tamil and Telugu and were therefore able to reach out
to many people. In course of time, the ideas of the South moved up to the North but it
was a very slow process. Sanskrit, which was still the vehicle of thought, was given a
new form. Thus, we find that the Bhagavata Purana of ninth century was not written
in the old Puranic form

•

A more effective method for spreading of the Bhakti ideology was the use of local
languages. The Bhakti saints composed their verses in local languages. They also
translated Sanskrit works to make them understandable to a wider audience.

•

Thus, we find Jnanadeva writing in Marathi, Kabir, Surdas and Tulsidas in Hindi,
Shankaradeva popularising Assamese, Chaitanya and Chandidas spreading their
message in Bengali, Mirabai in Hindi and Rajasthani.

•

In addition, devotional poetry was composed in Kashmiri, Telugu, Kannad, Odia,
Malayalam, Maithili and Gujarati.

•

The Bhakti saints believed that salvation can be achieved by all. They made no
distinction of caste, creed or religion before God.

•

They themselves came from diverse backgrounds. Ramananda, whose disciples
included Hindus and Muslims, came from a conservative brahman family. His
disciple, Kabir, was a weaver. Guru Nanak was a village accountant’s son. Namdev
was a tailor

•

The saints stressed equality, disregarded the caste system and attacked
institutionalised religion. The saints did not confine themselves to purely religious
ideas.

•

They advocated social reforms too. They opposed sati and female infanticide. Women
were encouraged to join kirtans. Mirabai and Lalla (of Kashmir) composed verses that
are popular even today.

•

Amongst the non-sectarian Bhakti saints, the most outstanding contribution was made
by Kabir and Guru Nanak. Their ideas were drawn from both Hindu and Islamic
traditions and were aimed at bridging the gulf between the Hindus and the Muslims.
Let us read in some detail about them.

•

Kabir (1440-1518) is said to have been the son of a brahman widow, who abandoned
him. He was brought up in the house of a Muslim weaver. Kabir believed that the way
to God was through personally experienced bhakti or devotion.

•

He believed that the Creator is One. His God was called by many names - Rama,
Hari, Govinda, Allah, Rahim, Khuda, etc. No wonder then that the Muslims claim
him as Sufi, the Hindus call him Rama-Bhakta and the Sikhs incorporate his songs in
the Adi Granth.

Altogether, when we see in medieval period
•

The Bhakti movement was a socio-religious movement that opposed religious bigotry
and social rigidities. It emphasised good character and pure thinking.

•

. At a time when society had become stagnant, the Bhakti saints infused new life and
strength. They awakened a new sense of confidence and attempted to redefine social
and religious values.

•

Saints like Kabir and Nanak stressed upon the reordering of society along egalitarian
lines. Their call to social equality attracted many a downtrodden. Although Kabir and
Nanak had no intention of founding new religions but following their deaths, their
supporters grouped together as Kabir panthis and Sikhs respectively

•

The importance of the Bhakti and Sufi saints lies in the new atmosphere created by
them, which continued to affect the social, religious and political life of India even in
later centuries. Akbar’s liberal ideas were a product of this atmosphere in which he
was born and brought up. The preaching of Guru Nanak was passed down from
generation to generation.

•

This resulted in the growth of a separate religious group, with its separate language
and script Gurmukhi and religious book, Guru Granth Sahib. Under Maharaja Ranjit
Singh, the Sikhs grew into a formidable political force in the politics of North India.

•

The major religious movements ca be traced in medieval period of India and They
contributed to the religious ideas and beliefs.

RELIGIOUS REFORMS MOVEMENT IN MODERN INDIA

In the first part of the nineteenth century, Indian society was caste-ridden,
decadent, and rigid.
Certain practises were followed that were not in line with humanitarian
attitudes or beliefs, but were still followed in the name of religion.
Some enlightened Indians, such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chand
Vidyasagar, Dayanand Saraswati, and others, began to reform society in
order to prepare it to face the challenges of the West.
Reformist movements such as the Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, and
the Aligarh Movement fall into one of two groups.
Arya Samaj and the Deoband movement are examples of revivalist
movements. Both the reformist and revivalist movements relied, to
differing degrees, on an appeal to the religion's lost purity in order to
reform it.
BRAHMO SAMAJ MOVEMENT:
Brahmo Sabha, which was later renamed Brahmo Samaj, was founded in
1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy.
Its primary goal was to worship the eternal God. Priesthood, ceremonies,
and sacrifices were all condemned.
It centred on prayers, meditation, and scripture reading. It thought that all
religions should be together.
It was modern India's first intellectual reform movement. It resulted in the
growth of rationalism and enlightenment in India, which aided the
nationalist movement indirectly.
It was the progenitor of all modern India's social, religious, and political
movements. In 1866, the Brahmo Samaj of India, led by Keshub Chandra
Sen, and the Adi Brahmo Samaj, led by Debendranath Tagore, split up.
Debendranath Tagore, Keshub Chandra Sen, Pt. Sivnath Shastri, and
Rabindranath Tagore were prominent leaders.
PRARTHANA SAMAJ:
Dr. Atma Ram Pandurang founded the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay in
1876 with the goal of rational worship and social reform.
R.C. Bhandarkar and Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade were two of the
Samaj's most prominent members.
They devoted themselves to social reform efforts such as inter-caste
dining, inter-caste marriage, widow remarriage, and the betterment of
women's and lower-class lives.

Prarthana Samaj's four-point social programme was: The caste system is
disliked, Education for women , remarriage of a widow, to raise the
marriage age for both men and women.
Mahavdev Govind Ranade founded the Widow Remarriage Association
(1861) and the Deccan Education Society He also founded the Poona
Sarvajanik Sabha.
Religious change, according to Ranade, was inextricably linked to social
reform.
He also believed that inflexible religious notions would lead to failure in
the social, economic, and political realms.
Despite being heavily influenced by Brahmo Samaj's principles,
Prarthana Samaj did not insist on a strict prohibition of idol worship and a
complete rupture from the caste system.
SATYASHODHAK SAMAJ:
Jyotiba Phule led a successful campaign against upper-caste dominance
and brahminical supremacy.
In 1873, he established the SatyashodhakSamaj (Truth Seekers' Society).
The movement's key goals were:
Service to the community
Women and others from lower castes are becoming more educated.
Sarvajanik Satyadharma and Ghulamgin, two of Phule's works, became
sources of inspiration for the common people.
In contrast to the brahmins' sign of Rama, Phule adopted the Rajah Bali
symbol.
The caste system and socioeconomic inequities were to be abolished
completely, according to Phule.
This movement provided depressed communities a feeling of class
identification in opposition to the Brahmins, who were considered as
exploiters.

ARYA SAMAJ MOVEMENT:
As a reaction to Western influences, the Arya Samaj Movement was
revivalist in appearance but not in content.
Dayananda Saraswati created the first Arya Samaj organisation in
Bombay in 1875, and the Samaj's headquarters were eventually
established in Lahore.
The Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V.) schools, which began in Lahore in
1886 and attempted to emphasise the importance of Western education,
supplied the nucleus for this movement.

The Arya Samaj was able to instil self-esteem and confidence in Hindus,
helping to debunk the notion of white superiority and Western civilization.
The Arya Samaj initiated the shuddhi (purification) drive to bring
Christians and Muslims back into the Hindu fold.
During the 1920s, this resulted in a growing communalisation of social
life, which subsequently snowballed into communal political
consciousness.
Lala Hansraj, Pandit Gurudutt, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Swami
Shraddhanand, among others, continued the Swami's work after his death.
The thoughts of Swami Dayananda were written in his well-known work,
Satyarth.

YOUNG BENGAL MOVEMENT:
The Hindu College of Calcutta's ideas were at the forefront of the
emerging Bengal movement. Derozians was another moniker for these
intellectuals. This name was given to them in honour of Henry Louis
Vivian Derozio, a professor at the same college.
Through his teaching and the organisation of an association for debate
and discussion on literature, philosophy, history, and science, Derozio
pushed radical ideals.
They believed in the ideals of the French Revolution (1789 A.D.) as well
as British liberal ideas.
Women's rights and education were equally important to the Derozians.
The fundamental reason for their limited success was the social climate at
the time, which was not conducive to radical ideas being adopted.
RAMAKRISHNA MOVEMENT:
Ramakrishna Paramhansa was a mystic who sought religious redemption
via renunciation, meditation, and devotion in the conventional ways.
He was a saint who recognised the underlying unity of all religions and
highlighted that there are numerous paths to God and salvation, and that
man's service is God's service.
The Ramakrishna Movement was founded on the teachings of
Ramakrishna Paramhansa.
In 1987, Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission, which
was named after his Guru, Swami Ramakrishna Paramhansa. In India, the
institute accomplished a lot of educational and social activity.
In 1893, he also represented India at the first Parliament of Religion,
which was held in Chicago, Illinois.

He used the Ramakrishna Mission to help people in need and to do social
work.
Religious and social transformation are the goals of the mission.
Vivekananda preached the philosophy of service, which he defined as
"serving all beings."
Shiva is worshipped through the service of jiva (living objects). Life is
religion in and of itself. The Divine resides inside man via service.
Vivekananda advocated for the use of technology and modern science to
benefit humanity.

THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY AND ANNIE BESANT
In the history of modern India's religion, society, and culture,
theosophical society has played a significant role. It was formed in 1875
in the United States by Madame H.P. Blavatsky, a Russian spiritualist,
and Col. H.S. Olcott, an American.
Its goal was to promote old faiths, philosophies, and science studies, as
well as the development of man's divine powers and the formation of a
universal brotherhood of man.
The Theosophical Society's headquarters in Adyar became a knowledge
centre with a collection of rare Sanskrit texts.
The society battled untouchability and campaigned for women's
empowerment. Annie Besant spent her entire life working for the
betterment of Indian society.
"The Indian effort is first and foremost the restoration, strengthening, and
uplifting of the traditional religions," she said of her goal.

Religion as a means of informal social control in India

Social control: Social control is a concept found in social science disciplines. Social
control is defined as a set of rules and standards in society that keep people bound to
traditional standards and the use of formalised mechanisms. The disciplinary model
foreshadowed the control model.

Formal means of social control:
Formal means of social control are those used by the government and other
organisations to enact social control through law enforcement mechanisms and
sanctions such as fines and imprisonment.
The goals and mechanisms of formal social control in democratic societies are
determined by elected representatives through legislation.
This provides the control mechanisms with a measure of public support and
voluntary compliance. The mechanisms used by the state to impose formal social
control range from the death penalty to curfew laws.
Sanctions are penalties or other forms of enforcement used to provide incentives for
compliance with the law, or rules and regulations.
Criminal sanctions may include severe punishment, such as corporal or capital
punishment, imprisonment, or heavy fines. In the context of civil law, sanctions are
typically monetary fines.
Max Weber's work on the use of violence by the state adds to our understanding of
formal control. In his essay "Politics as Vocation," Weber discusses the definitional
relationship between the state and violence in the early twentieth century. Weber
comes to the conclusion that the state has a monopoly on violence.
Informal means of social control:
Peer and community pressure, bystander intervention in a crime, and collective
responses such as citizen patrol groups are examples of informal social control, or the
reactions of individuals and groups that bring about conformity to norms and laws.
When informal social control is weaker, criminal justice system agents exercise more
control (Black, 1976).
People who know each other informally control each other subconsciously in subtle
ways.
Functions of religion:
Emile Durkheim's work emphasised the benefits of religion for society regardless of
how it is practised or which particular religious beliefs a society prefers.
The ideas of Durkheim still have an impact on contemporary sociological thinking
about the role of religion.
First, religion gives life direction and significance. Many things in life are challenging
to comprehend.
That was undoubtedly the case in ancient times, as we have seen, but even in today's
highly scientific age, many aspects of life and death remain a mystery. Many people

use their religious faith and beliefs to make sense of the things that science is unable
to explain.
Second, religion promotes social stability and cohesion. One of Durkheim's most
significant insights was this.
Social stability is strengthened by religion in at least two ways. First, it provides
people with a shared set of beliefs, making it a crucial socialisation tool.
Second, the communal practise of religion, such as that found in places of worship,
strengthens social ties by physically bringing people together and facilitating
communication and other forms of social interaction.
Related to the previous purpose, religion also serves a third purpose. Religion acts as
a social control mechanism, bolstering social order.
People who practise religion learn moral principles and how to behave in society. The
Ten Commandments are arguably the most well-known set of moral guidelines in the
Judeo-Christian tradition.
One area of informal social control, religion, is still controversial in terms of how it
affects deviance.
A fourth benefit of religion is improved mental and physical health. Religious belief
and practise can improve psychological health by providing consolation in difficult
times and by fostering social interaction with others in places of worship.
Numerous studies show that being religious makes people happier and more satisfied
with their lives overall, not just the elderly.
Additionally, it appears that religion fosters physical health, and some studies even
indicate that those who practise religion have a tendency to live longer than those who
do not (Moberg, 2008).
Religion as a means of informal social control
Depending on the metaphysical claims and moral code of a particular tradition,
religion's power as a social control mechanism may differ. For instance,
reincarnation-affirming Eastern religions hold that the merits one accrues through
good deeds in this life can determine one's existence in the next.
This idea held that leading a good life and helping the unfortunate could secure one a
noble birth in the afterlife, while leading a wicked and depraved life would result in
reincarnation as a miserable cockroach or pig.
People may adhere to normative standards as a result of such beliefs, even in the
absence of official social control mechanisms or outside observation.
Because of this, many people in Indian, Nepalese, and Sri Lankan societies where
these beliefs are prevalent may honour their parents, help the underprivileged, take
care of their children, and respect other people's property even in the absence of any
legal coercion.
According to Karl Marx, the use of religion by the oligarchy to uphold its power and
perpetuate inequality is a tactic. They defend capitalism's guiding principles and put
an end to the proletariat revolution.

Marxists contend that significant scientific advancements are driven by the desire to
make enormous profits, which only serves to strengthen capitalism.

Hinduism in India
Hello learners welcome to the session on Major religion in India
Hinduism in India
Hinduism is the religion of the Hindus, a name given to the Universal Religion which
hailed supreme in India.
It is the oldest of all living religions. This is not founded by any prophet.
Buddhism, Christianity and Mohammedanism owe their origin to the prophets. Their
dates are fixed.
But no such date can be fixed for Hinduism. Hinduism is not born of the teachings of
particular prophets.
It is not based on a set of dogmas preached by a particular set of teachers.
It is free from religious fanaticism.

Hinduism is also known by the names Sanatana-Dharma and Vaidika-Dharma.
Sanatana-Dharma means eternal religion. Hinduism is as old as the world itself.
Hinduism is the mother of all religions. Hindu scriptures are the oldest in the world,
Sanatana-Dharma is so called, not only because it is eternal, but also because it is
protected by God and because it can make us eternal.

Vaidika-Dharma means the religion of the Vedas. The Vedas are the foundational
scriptures of Hinduism.
The ancient Rishis and sages of India have expressed their intuitive spiritual
experiences (Aparoksha-Anubhuti) in the Upanishads. These experiences are direct
and infallible.
Hinduism regards the spiritual experiences of the Rishis of yore as its authority.
The priceless truths that have been discovered by the Hindu Rishis and sages through
millennia constitute the glory of Hinduism. Therefore, Hinduism is a revealed
religion.

Hinduism allows absolute freedom to the rational mind of man. Hinduism never
demands any undue restraint upon the freedom of human reason, the freedom of
thought, feeling and will of man.
It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship.

Hinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason
and heart with regard to questions such as nature of God, soul, creation, form of
worship and the goal of life.

Hinduism does not condemn those who deny God as the creator and ruler of the
world, who do not accept the existence of an eternal soul and the state of Moksha or
state of liberation.
Hinduism does not render the upholders of such views unfit to be recognised as pious
and honourable members of the Hindu religious society.

The religious hospitality of Hinduism is proverbial. Hinduism is extremely catholic
and liberal.
This is the fundamental feature of Hinduism. Hinduism pays respects to all religions.
It does not revile any other religion. It accepts and honours truth—wherever it may
come from and whatever garb it may put on.

That part of the great Aryan race which migrated from Central Asia, through the
mountain passes into India, settled first in the districts near the river Sindhu, now
called the Indus, on the other side of the river.
The Persians pronounced the word Sindhu as Hindu, and named their Aryan brethren
Hindus.
Hindu is only a corrupt form of Sindhu.
The Hindu Aryans spread themselves over the plains of the Ganga.
Hindu culture and Hindu civilisation were at their zenith in the days of yore.
Greeks and Romans imitated the Hindus and absorbed Hindu thoughts.
Even now Hindu culture and Hindu civilisation stand foremost in the world.
No religion has produced so many great saints, sages, Yogins, Rishis, Maharshis,
prophets, Acharyas, benefactors, heroes, poets, statesmen and kings.

Each and every province of the country has produced intellectual giants, poets and
saints.
Even now India abounds in Rishis, philosophers, saints and high intellectuals.
Even now she abounds in sages and great souls.
No religion is so very elastic and tolerant like Hinduism.
Hinduism is very stern and rigid regarding the fundamentals.

It is very elastic in readjusting to the externals and non-essentials.
That is the reason why it has succeeded in living through millennia

The glory of Hinduism is ineffable. It has within it all the features of a universal
religion.
Its Dharmas are universal. Its doctrines are sublime. Its philosophy is grand. Its ethics
is soul-elevating.
Its scriptures are wonderful. Its Sadhanas or Yoga-Vedantic practices are unique.

Glorious has been the past of this religion; still more glorious is its future.
It has a message to give to a world rent asunder by hatred, dissension and war—the
message of cosmic love, truth and non-violence, the gospel of unity of Self or
Upanishadic oneness.

More than nine-in-ten of the world’s Hindus live in India.
There are more than 1.1 billion Hindus in the world and roughly 94% of them live in
India, according to Pew Research Center projections for 2020. Eight-in-ten Indians
(79.8%) identify as Hindu, according to the country’s 2011 census.
Far fewer Indians are of other religions, including Islam (14.2%), Christianity (2.3%)
and Sikhism (1.7%).

The vast majority of India’s Hindus believe in God (98%), including eight-in-ten who
say they believe in God with absolute certainty.
Even though Hinduism is sometimes referred to as a polytheistic religion, very few
Hindus (7%) take the position that there are multiple gods.
The prevailing view, held by 61% of Hindus, is that there is one God “with many
manifestations.” About three-in-ten Indian Hindus (29%) say simply: “There is only
one God.”

Many Indian Hindus regularly perform puja – a worship practice that often involves
prayer and giving offerings to deities.
Most Hindus in India perform puja at home daily (55%). Fewer Hindus perform puja
at temples daily (20%).
Hindu women are much more likely than men to perform puja in their home daily
(64% vs. 47%), but there is no gender gap when it comes to performing puja at
temples.

Christianity in India
Introduction
In India, after Muslims, Christians make up the second-largest religious minority.
In India, there are 21 million Christians, or 2% of the country's overall population.
Roman Catholics make up the largest single Christian community in India with 16.5 million
people.
The number of Protestants worldwide is about 4.5. (Europa 1740). Kerala, one of the oldest
Christian communities in the world, has the highest concentration of Christians.
A Brief History
The history of the beginning of Christianity in India has generated debate among historians
because there is a paucity of documentary evidence.
The church was founded in India by the apostle Thomas in 52 A.D., according to legend and
tradition. He converted many people to Christianity by travelling along established trade
routes, including members of the royal family (Mundadan 25).
Many more foreign missionaries followed his lead and converted a large number of people to
Christianity.
Evangelizing to those from the lower castes and outcasts, Jesuit Saint Francis Xavier
expanded the Christian community westward in the 16th century.
The early Christians were drawn to Christianity's ideals of humility and renunciation of
material possessions. Christianity was viewed as "the poor man's religion" (Kooliman 102)
Protestant missionaries started working in India in the eighteenth century, which resulted in
the expansion of Christian communities (Bogard; Mayhew 47). "These new Christians were
almost entirely drawn from the most underprivileged and deplorable sectors of society"
(Kooliman 5).
Christianity and trade
The East India Trading Company's trade with India sparked a lifelong fascination with the
country. The trading corporation expanded its scope beyond simple commercial concerns and
rose to power in India.
During the period of 1770–1818, "almost a third of India was to come under the control of
the Company through wars and annexations" (Pathak 3).
It's interesting to note that numerous St. Thomas Christians were pepper harvesters. Growing
peppers was practically their only monopoly (Mundadan 155). The majority of the pepper
that was sent to Portugal was grown by church members.

IMPACT OF CHRISTIANITY IN INDIA

EDUCATION

The majority of Christian missionary work in India entailed opening top-notch educational
institutions. Of course, the influence of the Christian community does not stop there.
Printing presses came along with the schools, which helped in the spread of all sorts of
literature. In actuality, English and modern vernacular education were pioneered by early
overseas missionaries.
In his History of Indian Education, R. L. Rawat makes the argument that India will always be
grateful to the missionaries for the creation of textbooks, dictionaries, and grammars as well
as for their fervent efforts to expand education.
Observing the masses of individuals from all socioeconomic groups and religious affiliations
who use whatever power they can muster to get their kids into Christian schools is
undoubtedly one way to gauge the influence of Christianity in India.
Lower kindergarten is where the rush starts, and it continues through university institutions.
This happens even when parents—whether Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh—have to consent to
having their kids study the Bible as a required subject in school.
Language and Literature

In India, Christians have significantly influenced the fields of languages, literature, and
journalism. Tamil alphabetic characters were changed by Constanzio Beschi (1680–1747) to
make them more appropriate for printing.
In addition, he created a four-volume Tamil dictionary with sections for words, synonyms,
classes, and rhymes.
Notable translations of classic Tamil literature into English include those by G. U. Pope
(1820–1908) and Bishop Robert Caldwell (1815–1891), respectively.
Other Christian authors who created some of the earliest Tamil novels are Vedanayagam
Pillai (1824-1889) and H. A. Krishna Pillai (1827-1900).
In his book The Discovery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru recognises the role that the early
missionaries, particularly the Baptists of Serampore, had in the country's transition away
from the sway of Persian and Sanskrit.
According to Nehru, the publishing of books and newspapers by the missionaries and the
spread of English-language schooling undoubtedly reduced the influence of the classics and
facilitated the emergence and development of regional languages.
Nehru says that although missionaries dealing with the major languages had little trouble,
"they struggled with the dialects of the prehistoric hill tribes and forest tribes. Many Indian
languages were created as a result of Christian missionaries' ambition to translate the Bible
into as many languages as they could.

Although Christian mission work in India has not always been admirable or praiseworthy, it
has clearly been of immense benefit to India in this regard as well as in the preservation of
folklore " (Nehru, pp. 317–318).

Field of Medicine
Finally, an order banning sati in East India Company properties was signed by Lord William
Bentinck in 1829.
Another area where Christians have significantly impacted India's welfare and general wellbeing is the realm of medicine.
Late in the sixteenth century, Jesuits built infirmaries next to their residences.
In 1799, John Thomas, a collaborator of William Carey, started his work.
Almost every missionary group established medical facilities of various types in India during
the nineteenth century. Two have received recognition on a global scale.
The Christian Medical College Hospital in Vellore developed from Dr. Ida Scudder's
roadside clinics, which she initially started in 1895.
The first, the Christian Medical College Hospital in Ludhiana, was established by Dr. Edith
Brown in 1893.
Despite the influx of missionaries throughout the colonial era, there are still few Christians in
India, especially when compared to the country's 846,302,688 overall population (Europa
1726).
The establishment of the Church of South India and Church of North India in 1947 and 1970,
respectively, reduced ties among Protestant churches.
However, there are still representations of minor fundamentalist sects all over India, resulting
in a kaleidoscope mixture of ethnic groups, languages, cultures, viewpoints, theologies, and
customs.
Christians and churches interact with surrounding society in a wide range of ways, from
being a powerful minority in the state of Kerala to having a big impact on other southern and
northeastern states (Europa 1740).

Islam in India
INTRODUCTION:
•

Islam is a prominent international religion that was established by the Prophet
Muhammad in Arabia in the 7th century CE.

•

The Arabic phrase islam, meaning "submission," illustrates the core religious concept of
Islam—that the believer (called a Muslim from the active form of islam) accepts
surrender to Allah's God will.

•

Allah is regarded as the one God—the world's creator, sustainer, and restorer.

•

The sacred texts, the Qurn (commonly written Koran in English), which Allah revealed to
his prophet, Muhammad, convey Allah's will, to which humans must submit.

•

In Islam, Muhammad is regarded as the final in a line of prophets (along with Adam,
Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus), and his message both consummates and
completes the "revelations" credited to prior prophets.

•

The religion taught by Muhammad to a small group of followers grew fast over the
Middle East to Africa, Europe, the Indian subcontinent, the Malay Peninsula, and China,
while maintaining its emphasis on absolute monotheism and rigorous obedience to some
basic religious traditions.

•

By the early twenty-first century, there were about 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.

•

Despite the fact that several religious movements have emerged within Islam, all Muslims
are united by a shared religion and a sense of belonging to a single community.

HISTORY OF ISLAM:
•

Islam is considered to have originated in 610 CE, when Muhammad, a profoundly
spiritual and righteous man who spent months praying and contemplating himself in a
solitary cave near the town of Mecca, is said to have received heavenly
communications.

•

According to legend, one morning Muhammad heard the voice of the angel Gabriel,
through whom Allah communicated words of wisdom. The words were originally
spoken by Muhammad, then by his students, and ultimately written down as the Holy
Qur'an.

•

Thus, Muslims see the Qur'an as direct revelations from Allah rather than the creation
of Muhammad.

•

Islam, which literally means "resignation," was based on the Prophet Muhammad's
teachings as a statement of surrender to Allah's will.

•

The sacred scripture of Islam, the Qur'an, includes the Prophet's teachings that Allah
revealed to Muhammad.

•

Traditional Muslims believe that Allah is the one real God, without a partner or equal,
and that the inspiration for this belief system comes directly from God and the

Prophet Muhammad, the vehicle selected by God to communicate these teachings to
the entire people.
•

Muhammad is said to have returned from the cave enlightened. On his return, the first
person he preached to was his wife Khadija, who became the first disciple of this new
religion.

•

This inspired Muhammad to begin preaching the revelations to the general people
through his speeches.

•

Many people were moved by Qur'anic passages and converted to Islam of their own
free will. However, because the rising popularity of Islam threatened the lives of
Muhammad and his students, the whole community relocated from Mecca to Medina
around 622 CE.

•

This journey became known as Hijra and became a significant event in the history of
Islam.

•

The day of this migration marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. With the
acceptance of Islam by the inhabitants of Medina, the expansion of this new religion
gained speed.

•

Muhammad later captured and converted Mecca with well-organized finances and a
large army. He did not stop there, but dispatched ambassadors to many areas of
Arabia.

•

Today, Islam is the world's second most populous religion, with over 23% of the
world's population identifying as Muslim.

•

The main message of the Qur'an is faith in Allah, the one and only real God. Islam's
believers are typically classified into two groups: Sunni and Shia. Despite adhering to
the same faith, each group interprets some Islamic events and teachings differently.

•

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, rational and scientific
discourses in their search for knowledge, meaning and values.

•

A wide range of Islamic writings on history and philosophical theology show that
medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of individualism,
secularism, skepticism and liberalism.

ISLAM UNIVERSAL VALUES:
•

Islam supports some universal ideals that must influence our current ethical frameworks
and legal perceptions.

•

The term "universal" refers to overarching and general ideas and concepts that the Qur'an
and Prophet's traditions uphold for all human beings, not only Muslims, regardless of
colour, ethnicity, gender, or religion.

•

The four principles become more than just a set of regulations; they become a religious,
moral, legal, individual, and communal responsibility.
DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BEING:
•

This ideal applies to all people, regardless of their views, religion, colour, or ethnicity.

•

Certain faculties, most notably reason and free choice, display this dignity. Dignifying
humanity necessitates the respect and preservation of the individual's well-being and
freedom of choice.

PLURALISM AND TOLERATION OF DIVERSITY:
•

Another fundamental Islamic principle is the equality of all persons, regardless of
colour, race, or ethnicity.

•

Recognition of variety enables for mutual acceptance, toleration, and appreciation of
difference, which goes beyond simply tolerance or resignation."

•
JUSTICE AND EXCELLENCE:
Like human dignity, it (justice) is a universal, irreducible value that applies to everyone.
Justice implies diversity of sides, differing views, and thus requires impartiality.
INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC LIBERTIES:




Individual rights include the security of life and property, the protection of honour and
dignity, the sanctity and security of private life against state violation, the security of
personal freedoms, the protection of religious sentiments, and the equality of all
Muslims and non-Muslims before the law.
The right to protest against tyranny, freedom of expression, freedom of association,
freedom of conscience and conviction, protection against arbitrary detention, and the
right to participate in public life are all examples of political rights. The right to the
needs of life (food, housing, clothes, and education) is included in socio economic
rights.

Hello Learners, In this session, we are going to discuss on the Indian music and its
divisions.
Indian Music and its divisions
•

Art is an expression of all characteristics of the human mind aesthetically”. These
characteristics, i.e., the varied human emotions, are known as ‘RAS’. In Hindi,
‘ras’literally means a sugary juice. It signifies the ultimate satisfaction of ‘aanand’.
Human emotions can be categorized into nine sub-headings or ‘navras’.

•

The three art forms - music, dance and drama - have been an integral aspects of Indian
culture

•

Art reflects human emotions and human beings spontaneously express their frame of
mind through various art forms.

•

Singing, dancing, acting are attributes of performing arts. Music from time
immemorial has been the most popular art form of India. They are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa,
Dha, Ne the earliest tradition of Indian music may be traced to Sama Veda which
contained the slokas that were put to music. Chanting of Vedic hymns with prescribed
pitch and accent still form a part of religious rituals. The earliest text dealing
exclusively with performing arts is Bharata’s Natyashashtra (compiled between
second century BC and second century AD) which has six chapters on music.

•

Many rulers such as Samudragupta, King Bhoja of Dhara and King Someshavra of
Kalyana patronised music. The Gupta monarch Samudra Gupta was himself an
accompolished musician.

•

Music was also associated with the worship of Gods and Goddess in the temples. In
the twelfth century, Jayadeva of Orissa produced the most brilliant raga kavya, the
Gita Govinda, each song of whichwas set in a raga and was composed on the theme of
love of Radha and Krishna.

Divisions of Indian Classical Music
•

During the medieval period Indian classical music was broadly based on two
traditions, the Hindustani classical music prevalent in North India and the Carnatic
music of South India.

Hindustani Classical Music
•

Hindustani classical music may be traced back to the period of the Delhi Sultanate
and to Amir Khusrau (AD 1253-1325) who encouraged the practice of musical
performance with particular instruments. He is believed to have invented the sitar and
the tabla and is said to have introduced new ragas. Most of the Hindustani musicians
trace their descent to Tansen. Different styles of Hindustani music are Dhrupad,
Dhamar, Thumri, Khayal and Tappa. It is said that Tansen’s music had the effect of
magic. He could stop the rising waves of the Yamuna and by the force of his ‘Megh
Rag’ he could cause the rain to fall.

•

Amongst the stringed instruments the most famous are sitar, sarod, santoor and
sarangi. Pakhawaj, tabla and Mridangam are precussion or tal giving instruments.
Likewise, flute, shehnai and nadaswaram are some of the chief wind instruments.

•

The musicians of Hindustani classical music are usually associated to a gharana or a
particular style of music. Gharanas refer to hereditary linkages of musicians which
represent the core of the style and distinguish them from the other. The gharanas
function in gurushishya parampara, that is, disciples learning under a particular guru,
transmitting his musical knowledge and style, will belong to the same gharana. Some
famous gharanas are Gwalior gharana, Kirana gharana, and Jaipur gharana.

Carnatic music
•

The compositions in Carnatic music may be attributed collectively to three composers
who lived between AD 1700 and 1850. They were Shyam Shastri, Thyagaraja and
Mutthuswami Dikshitar. Purandardasa was another great composer of Carnatic music.
Thyagaraja is revered both as a saint and an artist and epitomises the essence of
Carnatic music. The main compositions are known as kriti and are devotional in
nature. The three great musicians experimented with new forms.

•

Flute, veena, nadaswaram, mridangam, ghatam is some of the instruments to
accompany Carnatic music.

•

Despite contrasting features between Hindustani and Carnatic music, one can find
some similarities

•

for example, the Carnatic alapana is similar to alap in Hindustani classical. Tilana in
Carnatic resembles Tarana of Hindustani. Both lay stress on tala or talam.

Modern Indian Music
•

With the British rule came Western music. Indians adopted some of their instruments
such as violin and clarinet to suit the demands of Indian music. Orchestration of
music on stage is a new development. Use of cassettes replaced oral transmission of
tunes and ragas. Music education no longer depends on the master-disciple system but
can be imparted through institutions teaching music.

Folk Music
•

Besides classical music India has a rich legacy of folk or popular music. This music
represents the emotion of the masses. The simple songs are composed to mark every
event in life. They may be festivals, advent of a new season, marriage or birth of a
child. Rajasthani folk songs such as Mand and Bhatiali of Bengal are popular all over
India. Ragini is a popular form of folk songs of Haryana. Folk songs have their
special meanings or messages. They often describe historical events and important
rituals. Kashmir’s Gulraj is usually a folklore and Pandyani of Madhya Pradesh is a
narrative put to music.

Hello Learners, in this session, we will discuss on the Indian Dance and Drama
Dances of India
•

Like music, Indian dance has also developed a rich classical tradition. It has a great
power of expression and emotions while telling a story. In India, the art of dancing
may be traced back to the Harappan culture. The discovery of the bronze statue of a
dancing girl testifies to the fact that some women in Harappa performed dances.

•

In traditional Indian culture the function of dance was to give symbolic expression to
religious ideas. The figure of Lord Shiva as Nataraja represents the creation and
destruction of the cosmic cycle. The popular image of Shiva in the form of Nataraja
clearly shows thepopularity of dance form on the Indian people.

•

There is not a single temple atleast in the southern part of the country which does not
show the sculptures of the dancers in their different forms. In fact, classical dance
forms like Kathakali, Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Manipuri, Kuchi pudi and Odishi are an
important part of our cultural heritage.

•

Gradually dances came to be divided as folk and classical. The classical form of
dance was performed in temples as well as in royal courts. The dance in temples had a
religious objective whereas in courts it was used purely for entertainment. In both
cases for the artists devoted to this art form, it was no less than praying to God.

•

In southern India Bharatanatyam and Mohiniattam developed as an important aspect
of the rituals in temples. Yakshagana, a form of Kathakali in Kerala, tells us stories of
Ramayana and Mahabharata whereas Kathak and Manipuri are mostly related to the
stories of Krishna and his leela (exploits). Performance of Odissi is related to the
worship of Lord Jagannath.

•

Manipuri dance was also performed for religious purposes. Folk dances evolved from
the lives of common people and were performed in unison. In Assam people celebrate
most of the harvesting season through Bihu. Similarly, Garba of Gujarat, Bhangra and
Gidda of Punjab, bamboo dance of Mizoram, Koli, the fisherman’s dance of
Maharashtra, Dhumal of Kashmir, and Chhau of Bengal are unique examples of
performing arts that gave expression to the joys and sorrows of the masses.

•

In the last few decades, the status of dance as well as its performers has changed.
Young people have started learning dance to enrich their personal qualities. In some
of the schools, colleges and universities separate departments have been established
for imparting training in dance. Several renowned classical dancers have been
awarded national awards like the Padmashree and the Padmabhusan.

•

Throughout the different periods of history starting from the dancing figure found in
the Indus valley civilization to the present, Indian people have expressed their joys
and sorrows by singing and dancing through various art forms. This art form has been
used to express their love, hatred, their aspirations and their struggle for survival
which ultimately led to the enrichment of our culture.

Drama: Indian Theatre

•

Indigenous tradition as well as modern research trace the origin of Indian drama to the
Vedas. In the Ramayana we hear of drama troupes of women while Kautilyas
Arthshastra mentions musicians, dancers and dramatic shows. Drama is a performing
art, which has also been practised since times immemorial. Drama could spring from
a child’s play. The child enacts, mimics, and caricates which was definitely the
beginning of drama.

•

While referring to drama, Bharata has mentioned nat (male artists), and nati (female
artist), music, dance, musical instruments, dialogues, themes and stage. Thus, we find
that drama achieved a great level of perfection during the age of Bharata. For Bharata,
drama is a perfect means of communication. He also started the concept of an
enclosed area for drama. There is mention of a community called’ shailoosh’ which
had professional drama companies. The practice of singing heroic tales became
popular. As a result, professional singers called kushilavas came into existence.

•

During the age of the Buddha and Mahavira, drama was a means of communicating
the principles of their respective religions. Short skits and long plays were enacted to
preach and educate the masses. Music and dance also played a vital role in increasing
the appeal of drama. In the ancient period till the tenth century, the language of the
educated, was Sanskrit. So, dramas were performed mostly in this language.

•

In the context of drama, two types developed- the classic drama, which had intricacies
of theme and subtle nuances of dramatic traits and folk theatre. It was of spontaneous
and extempore nature. Local dialect was used in folk theatre and hence in different
provinces many types of folk theatres developed. Acting with accompaniment of
music and dance was the popular practice. Many names were given to the forms of
folk theatre in different provinces like:

•

Bengal - Jatra, Kirtania Natak, Bihar-Bideshia, Rajasthan - Raas, Jhumar, Dhola
Maru, Uttar Pradesh - Raas, Nautanki, Svaang, Bhaand, Gujarat – Bhawaii,
Maharashtra - Larite, Tamasha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka - Kathakali,
Yakshagana

•

Modern Indian theatre emerged during British rule. It began as an outlet to vent
frustration against the rulers. Soon enough it became the medium through which
various socioeconomic issues like secularism, nationalism and casteism were
highlighted.

•

The association of people with these art forms definitely makes them better human
beings as the very nature of music, dance and drama elevates human soul and creates
a pleasant atmosphere. The knowledge and practice of these art forms help in the
development of one’s personality. The people involved in these art forms can attain
balance and peace of mind, self-restraint and love for all. Their performance makes
them self-confident and capable of adapting to all circumstances. Negative feelings
vanish as the soul of music, dance and drama teaches us all about loving and caring.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA
Hello learners welcome to the session SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA

Indians, like people in other parts of the world, have a rich tradition of scientific ideas.
The urge to know the unknown, along with experimentation and observation, has
always produced a scientific temper.
This has led to the idea that truth may be found in the real world, with all of its
diversity and complexities.
Indians, like people in other parts of the world, have a rich tradition of scientific ideas.
The urge to know the unknown, along with experimentation and observation, has
always produced a scientific temper.
This has led to the idea that truth may be found in the real world, with all of its
diversity and complexities.
On the following slides, you will learn about India's ongoing quest for knowledge and
truth, which has resulted in discoveries and inventions, as well as their application in
daily life.

DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN ANCIENT INDIA
Ganita is the broad word for mathematics, which covers arithmetic, geometry, algebra,
astronomy, and astrology. Arithmetic has various names, including Anka Ganita
(calculations on board), Pattin Ganita (calculations with numerals).
Geometry is referred to as Rekha Ganita (line works), and Algebra, Bija Ganita (seed
analysis), Astronomy, and Astrology are all referred to as Jyotisa.
India has a rich scientific and technological background. Science advancements may
be able to alleviate our reliance on nature. Religion and science collaborated closely
in ancient India.
Let us investigate the advancements in several disciplines of knowledge throughout
the ancient times.
ASTRONOMY:
Astronomy has made remarkable strides. Planetary motion became emphasised and
extensively monitored.
The Jyotishvedanga texts established systematic categories in astronomy, while
Aryabhatta dealt with the more fundamental issue (499 AD).
In ancient India, astrology and horoscopes were studied. Aryabhatta's theories marked
a significant change from astrology, which emphasised beliefs above scientific studies.
MATHEMATICS:
Harappa's urban planning demonstrates that the residents were well-versed in
measurement and geometry.
By the third century AD, mathematics had evolved into a distinct field of study. The
Sulvasutras are thought to be the source of Indian mathematics.
In the second century BC, Zero was found in India.

Brahmagupta's Brahmasputa Siddhanta was the first text to mention 'zero' as a number;
thus, Brahmagupta is known as the one who discovered zero.
He explained how to use zero with other numbers. Aryabhatta discovered algebra as
well as the area of a triangle, which led to the development of trignometry.
MEDICINE:
Takshila and Taranasi evolved as medical and educational hubs.
Charaksamhita by Charak and Sushrutsamhita by Sushruta are two prominent texts in
this topic.
The fact that their work spread as far as China and Central Asia through translations
in several languages demonstrates the significance of their efforts.
The plants and herbs that are used for medical purposes are listed in the
Charaksamhita. Around the fourth century AD, surgery was listed as a separate stream.
Sushruta was a forerunner in this field.
METALLURGY
By the first century AD, mass manufacturing of metals such as iron, copper, silver,
and gold, as well as alloys such as brass and bronze, was underway.
The iron pillar in the Qutub Minar complex demonstrates the exceptional level of
alloying that took place.
Alkali and acids were created and used to make medications.
This process was also employed in other crafts such as dyeing and colouring.
Dyeing textiles was popular. The quality of colour is reflected in the Ajanta frescoes.
These artworks have survived to the present day.
GEOGRAPHY:
People were compelled to study geography as a result of the ongoing interplay
between man and nature.
Though the people were aware of their own physical geography, as well as that of
China and Western countries, they were unaware about their position on the globe and
the distances between countries.
Indians also helped with shipbuilding. The Indians were unfamiliar with travel and
navigation during the ancient period.

DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA:
During the medieval era (the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries), science and technology
in India progressed along two lines: one concerned with the previously defined trajectory of
earlier traditions, and the other with new influences that emerged as a result of Islamic and
European influence.
There were maktabs and madrasas that followed a fixed curriculum. These institutions used
to be patronised by the monarch.
Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Azzizullah, Rational Sciences (Magulat) specialists, led the
madrasas in Sambhal and Agra.
In these madrasas, learned individuals from Arabia, Persia, and Central Asia were invited to
teach.
The kings and nobility maintained a huge number of karkhana (workshops) to supply
provisions, stocks, and equipment to the royal household and government offices.
The karkhanas not only acted as manufacturing agencies, but also as technical and vocational
training centres for young men.
The karkhanas trained and produced artisans and craftsmen in various fields, who ultimately
established their own independent karkhanas (workshops).
Muslim monarchs attempted to improve primary school curricula. Some key disciplines,
including as arithmetic, mensuration, geometry, astronomy, accountancy, public
administration, and agriculture, were included in the primary education curriculum.
Attempts were made to achieve a form of synthesis between Indian traditional scientific
culture and the prevalent scientific approach in other nations.
MATHEMATICS:
Brahmagupta, the renowned 7th century mathematician, described negative numbers as debts
and positive numbers as riches,
demonstrating that ancient Bharatiyas recognised the use of mathematics in practical trade.
CHEMISTRY:
The Mughals were well-versed in the manufacturing of gunpowder and its application in
firearms.
Indian artisans learned the technology and developed appropriate explosive formulations.
They were aware of the procedure of preparing gunpowder in various ratios of saltpetre,
sulphur, and charcoal for use in various sorts of cannons.
The most common types of fireworks were those that pierced the air (rockets), generated
sparks of fire, flared with varied colours, and finished in an explosion
ASTRONOMY:
A variety of remarks on already established astronomical conceptions occurred in astronomy.
The principal observatories were in Ujjain, Varanasi, Mathura, and Delhi. Firoz Shah
Tughaq set up monitoring points in Delhi.
Firoz Shah Bahmani established an observatory in Daulatabad under the supervision of
Hakim Hussain Gilani and Syed Muhammad Kazimi.
There were both lunar and solar calendars in use.
MEDICINE:
There was an attempt to create specialised treatises on various ailments. For diagnostic
purposes, pulse and urine tests were performed. Opium is recommended for medicinal
purposes by the Sarangdhara Samhita.

The rasachikitsa method was primarily concerned with a wide range of mineral medicines,
including metallic preparations. The Tuhfat-ul-Muminin was a seventeenth-century Persian
treatise composed by Muhammad Munin that discussed the viewpoints of physicians.
AGRICULTURE:
The pattern of agricultural activities in the mediaeval period was similar to that of early and
early ancient India. However, foreigners were responsible for some significant modifications,
such as the introduction of new crops, trees, and horticulture species. Wheat, rice, barley,
millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane, and indigo were the main crops.
The Western Ghats continued to produce high-quality black pepper, and Kashmir retained its
saffron and fruit traditions. Tamilnadu's ginger and cinnamon, as well as Kerala's cardamom,
sandalwood, and coconuts, were becoming increasingly popular.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN MODERN INDIA
The government of India has recognised the importance of science and technology in national
growth.
The Second Five Year Plan emphasised that "the community's readiness to apply modern
science and technology is the most significant single component in supporting economic
development.
" The Department of Research and Technology (DST) was established in 1971 to encourage
new areas of science and technology.
State Science and Technology Councils have also been established at the state level.
AGRICULTURE:
The application of contemporary science and technology in agriculture has enabled India to
produce 135 million tonnes of foodgrains now, up from 50 million tonnes thirty years ago.
These applications span from hybrid seed cultivation to agricultural energy management and
post-harvest technology.
The Indian Council for Agricultural Research has taken the lead in these initiatives. The
agricultural colleges include 73 agricultural, 32 veterinary, eight agricultural engineering, and
one dairy institution.
ICAR has played an important role in the scientific education of farmers as well as those
involved in agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry.

INDUSTRY:
Modern science and technology made their first and most significant impact in the realm of
industry. The government of India has continually attempted to utilise modern science and
technology for economic development.
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO) are two government organisations that handle a wide
variety of science and technology research for civil and defence reasons.

NUCLEAR ENERGY:
The goal of India is to use nuclear energy for peaceful reasons.
India has achieved substantial advances in nuclear technology over the last sixty-three years,
since the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948.
The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) was established in Trombay in 1957. It is the
country's largest single scientific establishment.
SPACE TECHNOLOGY:
The Indian space programme is aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in the utilisation of space
technology for national development.
The space programme has established itself through a series of accomplishments over the
years. They include the first launch of Aryabhatta, an Indian space satellite, was launched in
1975, followed by Bhaskara I and Bhaskara II from the Soviet Union.
MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES:
Many advances have been made in the world of medicine. Significant progress has been
made in the prevention and treatment of different diseases.

The small pox virus has been eradicated. The treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis,
malaria, filaria, goitre, and cancer has improved significantly.
Apart from the major areas mentioned above, India has made much progress in several other
fields as well.
These include the activities of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission oil exploration and
refining and of the National Committee Environment Planning in environment protection and
production of solar energy.
A Central Ganga Aurthority has been set up to check pollution in the river Ganga by using
sewage treatment plants.
WITH THIS WE COME TO THE END OF OUR SESSION.
I HOPE YOU WOULD HAVE GOT A FAIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA
THANK YOU AND HAPPY LEARNING

INDIAN MUSIC
India is the inheritor of one of the oldest and most evolved musical systems in the world.
Its music is considered as the oldest unbroken musical tradition with the most intricate
musical system that contains highly developed polyrhythms, delicate nuances, ornamentation,
and microtones.
Remember

Elements of Indian Music
Indian Music: Musical Background
The music of India includes multiple varieties of folk, popular, pop, classical music and
R&B. India's classical music tradition, including Carnatic and Hindustani music, has a history
spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, it remains fundamental to the lives of
Indians today as sources of spiritual inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment.
India is made up of several dozen ethnic groups, speaking their own languages and dialects,
having very distinct cultural traditions.

Classical Music Tradition: Carnatic Music
Carnatic music is a very complex system of music that requires much thought, both
artistically and technically.
Classical Music Tradition: Carnatic Music
The basis of Carnatic music is the system of ragas (melodic scales) and talas (rhythmic
cycles). There are seven rhythmic cycles and 72 fundamental ragas. All other ragas are
considered to have originated from these. An elaborate pattern exists for identifying these
scales, known as the 72 Melakarta Raagas.
Classical Music Tradition: Carnatic Music
The basis of Carnatic music is the system of ragas (melodic scales) and talas (rhythmic
cycles). There are seven rhythmic cycles and 72 fundamental ragas. All Other ragas are
considered to have originated from these. An elaborate pattern exists for identifying these
scales, known as the 72 Melakarta Raagas. Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama
Shastri, the three saint composers of the 19th century, have composed thousands of krithis
that remain fresh among musicians and rasikas. The most important specialty of Karnatic
music is its highly devotional element. The concept of the compositions is set entirely against
a devotional outline. The notes of Carnatic music are "sa-ri-gaa-ma-pa-da-ni". These are
abbreviations of the real names of swaras which are Shadjam, Rishabham, Gandharam,
Madhyamam, Panchamam, Dhaivatam and Nishaadam.

Classical Music Tradition: Hindustani Music
It is unclear when the process of differentiation of Hindustani music started. The process may
have started in 14th century courts of the Delhi Sultans. However, according to Jairazbhoy,
the North Indian tradition likely acquired its modern form after the 14th or after the 15th
century. The Hindustani music development reached a peak in the Indian subcontinent during
the reign Of Akbar. During this 16th century period, Tansen studied music and introduced
musical innovations, for about the first sixty years of his life with patronage of the Hindu
king Ram Chand of Gwalior, and thereafter performed at the Muslim court of Akbar. Many
musicians in northern Indian subcontinent consider the 16th century Tansen as the founder of
Hindustani classical music.
Classical Music Tradition: Hindustani Music
Hindustani music style is mainly found in North India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It exists in
four major forms:Dhrupad, Khyal (or Khayal), Thumri and Tappa. Dhrupad is ancient, Khyal
evolved from it, Thumri evolved from Khyal. Dhrupad is solemn music, uplifting and heroic,
pure and spiritual. Khyal adds ornamental notes, shorter, moody and celebratory. Thumri
goes one step further in their brevity, and are graceful songs. There are three major schools of
Thumri: Lucknow gharana, Banaras gharana and Punjabi gharana. These weave in folk music
innovations Tappa is the most folksy, one which likely existed in Rajasthan and Punjab
region before it was systematized and integrated into classical music structure. It became
popular, with the Begali musicians developing their own Tappa.

Genres of North Indian vocal music

• Dhrupad (several centuries old)
Less popular today; religious themes

• Khayal (prominent in last 200 years)

— Most widely sung form of classical music; heavy on virtuosic improvisations

Vocal Music of India
Vocal music, from the very beginning of human civilization, has been the leader and the
kingpin of all forms of music. Without doubt it has been the greatest single purveyor of the
deeper artistic and musical urges of man and the means through which these urges have
found artistic expression. As against vocal music, however, instrumental music is a derived
form of music. Nevertheless, instrumental music is perhaps the finest extrapolation of the
creative and inner urges of the artist and musical composer. In point of fact there is such a
deep complimentary between vocal and instrumental music that it is impossible to visualize
any musical performance without both of them existing together.



Vocal music is considered very important and the most ancient of all its musical
traditions. It is also well regarded and well appreciated by its people.
Samaveda — the old musical texts in India which have crude musical notations.

The performance of vocal music is a form of prayer and communication to the
Supreme Being.
For them, a song is a vehicle or medium for communication and interaction process
between the worshipper and the deity.
Vocal music in India is a way to express deep devotion to God.
It is manifested through the art of vocalization, which becomes more than just a vocal
warm-up but an act of worship. It is accompanied by long hours of physical practice
and yoga.

Most notable songs of North India:
 Dhun or Kirtan for Hindus

and readily enjoyable fixed compositions. In both instrumental music and vocal music there

octaves and types of male and female voice. In vocal music, for instance, we have the form of

its myriad forms – carnal, devotional and maternal – with accent more on lasya and
bhava. In the main items cholkettu, padavarnam and padam, mudras and facial

Northern Kathak.
Katha means story.
Later added mime and gestures to accompany their storytelling.
The dance focuses on rhythm mostly but also concentrates on erotic steps.
An interesting piece of cross-cultural reference and tidbit of information.
Kathak was primarily associated with an institution known as the tawaif. This is a
much-misunderstood institution of female entertainers, very much like the geisha
tradition of Japan. It was a profession which demanded the highest standards of
training, intelligence, and most important, civility. It is said that it was common for
royalty to send their children to the tawaifs for instruction in etiquette. Unfortunately,
when the British consolidated their hold over Indian during the Victorian era, this
great institution was branded as mere prostitution and was a reawakening in interest in
traditional Indian artforms.
